        <p class="text-gallery"> The intestinal mesentery of a Prox1-GFP P0
          newborn transgenic mouse pup was carefully dissected out from the
          intestines and whole-mount immunostained for GFP (Prox1, green –
          lymphatic vessels) and CD31 (red – blood vessels), covering the
          complete plumbing of the intestines. The immunostained mesentery was
          flat-mounted on a slide with spacers and imaged on the Carl Zeiss
          LSM710 inverted confocal microscope using C-Apochromat 40X/1.2 W
          objective, 0.6X zoom, 561 and 488 lasers, z-stack and tile functions.
          Images were stitched on Imaris and further processed using its maximum
          intensity projection and smoothening functions. As can be seen from
          the image, the intestines have a beautiful plumbing system of
          lymphatic and blood vasculature that drain into the mesenteric sac at
          the root (centre). The scale bar corresponds to 700um. </p>

      <p>NOBIC has organised an image contest for users of NOBIC imaging
        facilities (AOBIP at LKCMedicine and ABIF at SCELSE) following in the
        tradition of <a href="ImContest21.html" title="NOBIC Image Contest 2021"

          target="_blank">NOBIC Image Contest 2021</a>. The contest was open for
        image submission between 15th June and 1st August 2023. We have received
        20 images which were then anonymously evaluated by an international
        panel of judges comprising representatives from academia and industry:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prof. Peter Török, NOBIC, NTU, Singapore, panel chair</li>
        <li>Dr. Ma Xiao Xiao, A*STAR Microscopy Platform, Singapore, panel vice
          chair</li>
        <li>Dr. Sohail Ahmed, United Kingdom, formerly of the Institute of
          Medical Biology, A*STAR, Singapore</li>
        <li>Dr. Astrid Bjørkøy, Norwegian University of Science and Technology,
          Norway</li>
        <li>Dr. Samuel Ko, Carl Zeiss Pte Ltd, Singapore</li>
        <li>Dr. Marie Kodedová, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of
          Sciences, Czech Republic</li>
      </ul>
      <p> In the first round, the judges selected 10 finalists and in the second
        round they selected 3 winners from among the finalists. We'd like to
        congratulate here to the winners and finalists and to express our thanks
        to the panel of judges. Last but not least, we'd like to thank all
        participants of the contest. There were more great images than there
        could be finalists. We hope many more equally fascinating images will be
        acquired at NOBIC Facilities and we are looking forward to helping you
        along the journey.</p>
      <p>Prizes for the winners were contributed the contest sponsor Carl Zeiss
        Pte Ltd. </p>

        The image shows the adult zebrafish (dissected) olfactory organ. It is
        remarkable and surprising to learn of their beautiful 3D rosette shaped
        morphology. The zebrafish line used was Tg(cldnh:eGFP). The GFP is
        driven by a cldnh gene promoter. Cldnh in humans is normally involved in
        retinal development, but in the zebrafish it is expressed in sensory
        cells. Here it is strongly expressed in many classes of olfactory
        sensory neurons (green), which bind to odorants in the external
        environment and give rise to the sense of smell. The organ is stained
        with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin, which shows F-actin structures, a key
        cytoskeletal component (magenta).</p>
