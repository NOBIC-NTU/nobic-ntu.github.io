        acquired by pressing the <strong>Reuse</strong> button in the <a href="#Dimensions">Dimensions
          tab</a> under the open image. In case no suitable settings from the
        past are available, we can configure the settings from scratch as
        described here. You can also watch a <a href="https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/us/local/zen-knowledge-base/zen-knowledge-base-lsm-700-780-880.html?wvideo=me7a6bww95"

        (external link).</p>
      <h2 class="h2">1. Setting up laser excitation </h2>
      <p>We can switch on the lasers we want to use in the <strong>Laser </strong>panel
        (<strong style="color: #33ccff;">E4</strong>). The 405 nm diode laser
        because of its fast response is switched on automatically only when
        needed (during image acquisition only). The <strong>Argon laser is
          switched on manually</strong> as a part of the switching-on procedure.
        The software receives no feedback whether the laser is on or off, thus
        it will give no error message if you select a line of the Argon laser in
        your channel settings without having turned the laser on. However no
        excitation light would reach the sample.</p>
      <p>The desired laser line(s) need to be selected also in the <strong>Channels</strong>
        panel (<b style="color: #ffcc33;">C1</b>, 561 nm is selected in the
        example). The slider below the check boxes allows setting the laser
        power (in % of the full power); refer to the table of the <a href="PDFs/LSM780_power.pdf"
          target="_blank">actual laser powers</a> at sample plane.</p>
      <a class="anchor" name="ChannelPan" id="ChannelPan"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/LSM780/Channels.PNG"
        alt="" title="Channels panel"> <br>
      <br>
      <h2 class="h2">2. Setting up dichroic mirrors </h2>
      <p>Next we select the <strong>dichroic mirrors</strong> to suit the
        lasers in the <strong>Imaging Setup</strong> panel (<b style="color: #ff6600;">I1</b>).
        There are two laser ports, each using a different dichroic. One,
        labelled <strong>Invisible Light</strong>, is used only by the 405 nm
        laser. The other port, <strong>Visible Light</strong>, by the remaining
        lasers. Select a suitable dichroic from the drop-down menu. There are <strong>multi-band
          dichroics</strong> that work several laser lines (e.g. the one in the
        exampl<a class="anchor" name="ChannelPan" id="ChannelPan"></a>e for 488
        nm, 561 nm and 633 nm), together with the 405 nm laser coming by the
        Invisible Light port, we can have up to 4 laser lines reaching the
        sample simultaneously.</p>
      <a class="anchor" name="ImSetup" id="ImSetup"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/LSM780/4channels.PNG"
        alt="" title="Imaging Setup">
      <p>Not all combinations of laser lines have a dichroic mirror available.
        There is for example no dichroic for 514 nm and 633 nm simulatenously.
        Those lasers cannot be sent to the sample simultaneously, can be used
        only sequentially using the feature of <a href="#Tracks">Tracks</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Important: If you are not using one of the ports</strong> (e.g.
        not using 405 nm laser), select the option "<strong>Plate</strong>" for
        that port. A glass plate of the same thickness as the mirrors is
        inserted to the optical path to maintain the beam path identical as when
        a dichroic mirror is there. Selecting option "None" would change the
        path of the beam as it would not undergo the shift caused by refraction
        on air/glass interfaces.</p>
      <h2 class="h2">3. Setting up detection channels</h2>
      <p><strong></strong> Then we set up the <strong>detectors</strong> for
        each channel in the <strong>Imaging Setup</strong> panel in <strong>Channel</strong>
        mode (<b style="color: #ff6600;">I0</b>). There are two types of
        photomultiplier tubes - standard multi-alkali PMTs (<strong>Ch1</strong>
        and <strong>Ch2</strong>) and more sensitive GaAsP PMTs (<strong>ChS</strong>).
        While Ch1 and Ch2 are each a single PMT, <strong>ChS</strong> (S stands
        for "spectral") is an <strong>array of 32 detectors</strong> covering a
        fixed spectral range from 410 nm to 695 nm (8.9 nm band/detector in
        array). The array of 32 detectors can be divided into several
        non-overlapping detection channels. New channels are added by pressing
        the "+" sign (<b style="color: #ff6600;">I2</b>). 4 channels are shown
        in the example. Spectra of fluorophores from the database in ZEN (<b style="color: #ff6600;">I3</b>)
        can be displayed and used as a guideline for selecting the spectral
        ranges of individual detection channels. Lookup tables (colours) can be
        defined for each channel (<b style="color: #ff6600;">I4</b>).</p>
      <p><strong>ChS</strong> has the advantage of higher sensitivity, making it
        the recommended detector choice. The standard PMTs Ch1 and Ch2 have the
        possibility to detect beyond the spectral range accessible by ChS on
        both the short wavelength side (not very useful when the shortest
        excitation laser is 405 nm) and long wavelength side (up to 740 nm for
        NIR emitting dyes).</p>
      <p>A <strong>transmitted light PMT</strong> can be also selected (<b style="color: #ff6600;">I5</b>),
        which detects the laser light that has passed through the sample. It can
        be then used to create a <strong>brightfield or DIC</strong> (depending
        on the setting of the condenser<strong><span style="color: #8fc049;"></span></strong>)
        image of the sample. This image comes at no additional cost in terms of
        acquisition time or exposure of the sample to light and provides
        information complementary to the fluorescence channels. For optimal
        transmitted light images quality, the condenser needs to be aligned for
        <a href="Aurox_Manual.html#Koehler" target="_blank"> Koehler
          illumination</a>.</p>

      <p>Checking the "<strong>Reflection</strong>" checkbox (<b style="color: #ff6600;">I6</b>)
        removes laser blocking filters from the detection path to allow

      <p>The <strong>detector gain</strong> is set in the <a href="#ChannelPan">Channels
          panel</a> (<b style="color: #ffcc33;">C2</b>). Gains in the range 500
        - 800 V are typically needed for fluorescence, lower values (100 - 300 V
        usually) are sufficient for transmitted light. Digital gain is just a
        multiplicative factor and as such does not affect the image quality
        (signal-to-noise ratio) unlike the real gain. Setting to values higher
        than 1 only increases the risk of exceeding the dynamic range (bit
        depth) of the digital image. The elements of the spectral detector <strong>ChS</strong>
        do not have independent gain, thus the same value of gain will apply to
        all channels using the detector array.</p>

      <p>Pinhole size is set in <a href="#ChannelPan">Channels panel</a> (<b style="color: #ffcc33;">C3</b>).
        The usual setting is <strong>1 AU</strong> (smaller pinhole size
        results in a significant loss of signal, while lager sizes compromise
        optical sectioning. Note that Airy units are relative to emission
        wavelength, thus the actual pinhole size depends on detection channels
        setting. The approximate section thickness is shown below the slider.</p>
      <h2 class="h2">5. Setting up scanning </h2>
      <p>We move to <strong>Acquisition Mode</strong> panel now. We need to
        define the <strong>scanning speed</strong> (<strong style="color: #cc33cc;">A1</strong>),
        the size of the scanned area (<strong>Zoom</strong>) (<strong style="color: #cc33cc;">A2</strong>)
        and <strong>sampling</strong> of the image (Frame Size - into how many
        pixels will the scanned image be divided) (<strong style="color: #cc33cc;">A3</strong>)<strong></strong>.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/LSM780/AcqMode.PNG" alt="" title="Acquisition Modes">
      <p><strong>Zoom</strong> (<strong style="color: #cc33cc;">A2</strong>) is
        what defines the scanned area as well as the <strong>effective
          magnification of the confocal image</strong>. The smallest zoom factor
        is smaller than 1 (the largest possible scanned area; consider zoom
        factor 1 as the smallest recommended zoom (largest recommended area) in
        terms of maximising image uniformity and minimising aberrations. The
        actual <strong>size of the scanned area</strong> (Image Size) in μm is
        displayed together with the pixel size (the scan size divided by the
        number of pixels).</p>
      <p>If you want to zoom to a particular feature which is not necessarily in
        the centre of the field of view, you can use the <strong>Crop button</strong>
        in the <a href="#Dimensions">Dimensions tab</a> under the image, which
        will allow you to define a custom scanned area.</p>
      <p>The <strong>pixel size</strong> thus depends on the Zoom as well as on
        the Frame Size (<strong style="color: #cc33cc;">A3</strong>). When too
        large (too few pixels), they limit the resolution of the image
        (pixelated image). On the other hand too high number of pixels (too
        small pixels) will either increase the acquisition time or reduce the
        pixel dwell time (compromising signal-to-noise ratio). <strong>The
          optimal (Nyquist) sampling</strong> is such that the pixel is slightly
        smaller than half of the theoretical optical resolution limit
        (diffraction limited). You can set it automatically by pressing "<strong>Optimal</strong>".
        <strong>Do not forget to optimise the Frame Size every time you change
          Zoom</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Pixel Dwell time and Scan Time </strong>(<strong style="color: #cc33cc;">A1</strong>)
        are determined by scanning speed and Frame Size. Slower scanning
        increases Pixel Dwell and therefore the amount of signal collected in
        each pixel. For live samples is may be advisable to avoid very slow
        scanning (prolonged continuous exposure of the same area in the sample
        to laser light), but rather to increase the effective time per pixel by
        <strong>repeatedly scanning each line or the whole frame</strong> (<strong
          style="color: #cc33cc;">A4</strong>).</p>
      <p>Other setting (<strong style="color: #cc33cc;">A5</strong>) available
        in this panel include the <strong>bit depth</strong> of the image and <strong>direction
          of scanning</strong> (mono- or bi-directional). Scan Time can be
        reduced twice by using <strong>bi-directional scanning</strong>
        (collecting data when the beam moves from left to right as well as from
        right to left). Scan artefacts (odd and even lines are shifted with
        respect to each other) may appear in his case. They can be&nbsp;
        corrected by adjusting CorrX and CorrY; this is an topic recommended
        only for adventurous users.<br>
        <strong></strong></p>
      <h2 class="h2">6. Scanning an image </h2>
      <p>We are now set to scan a multi-channel image by pressing either <a href="#Acquisition">Live,
          Continuous or Snap</a> (<b style="color: #33ccff;">E2</b>). The
        difference is that <strong>Live</strong>, being intended for a fast
        preview (e.g. during focusing or stage movement) uses high scanning
        speed, 512 x 512 pixels frame and no line or frame averaging, regardless
        of what you set in <strong>Acquisition Mode</strong> panel. <strong>Continuous</strong>,
        on the other hand, continuously scans using the full settings, while <strong>Snap</strong>
        scans a single frame (using the full settings).</p>
      <p>The image is displayed in the main window. The display of the image can
        be controlled in the panels below it and along its left-hand side. The
        left-hand side panel allows toggling between <strong>overlay of
          channels</strong> (2D) and <strong>split view</strong>. <strong>Dimensions
          tab</strong> allow selecting which channels are displayed (the magenta
        channel is off in the example), Graphics panel allows adding annotations
        to the image (e.g. a scalebar). The <a href="Aurox_Manual.html#Histogram"
          target="_blank">image histogram</a> for all channels is also shown.</p>

        src="Media/Manuals/LSM780/dimensions.PNG" alt="" title="Dimensions">
      <p>In case the histogram shows that the signal is low (all pixel values
        are close to zero, only a small fraction of the dynamic range is
        utilised) consider some of the following approaches to increase signal:</p>

                <li>Be cautious when <strong>increasing laser power</strong>,
                  especially when working with live samples. <strong>Fluorescence
                    intensity saturates</strong>, meaning that when excitation
                  intensity exceeds a certain threshold, there will be no
                  further increase in fluorescence intensity&nbsp; with
                  increasing excitation intensity. In some cases, fluorophore
                  bleaching and/or phototoxicity may become and issue even below
                  the saturation threshold. </li>
                <li>Avoid using excessive <strong>detector gain</strong>. At
                  very high gain levels, noise will be over-amplified and
                  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compromised. The weaker the
                  signal, the higher the gain that gives the best SNR, but in

      <h1 class="h1"><a id="Tracks" class="mozTocH1"></a>Confocal scanning -
        setting up tracks:</h1>
      <p>So far we have set up all channels to be acquired simultaneously. This
        is not always the optimal approach. For example DAPI spectrum as shown
        in the example of <a href="#ImSetup">Imaging Setup panel</a> overlaps
        strongly with the spectrum of EGFP and to some extend even with DsRed
        spectrum. Thus if all laser lines are on at the same time, the EGFP
        channel will receive a large contribution from DAPI, making it
        impossible to separate those two fluorophores. In such cases sequential
        excitation can help. DAPI is excited only when the signal in the DAPI
        channel is collected and not when EGFP is excited and the signal in EGFP
        channel collected.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/LSM780/4Tracks.PNG" alt="" title="Tracks">
      <p>This can be implemented using a feature called <strong>Tracks </strong>(<b
          style="color: #ff6666;">T1</b>). New Tracks can be added by the "<strong>+</strong>"
        button. 4 Tracks are shown in the example. Track 1 is active, thus the
        settings we currently see and can edit apply to Track 1. Different laser
        lines and detection channels can be on in each Track. In this case DAPI
        channel is on in Track 1 and that means that most likely only 405 nm
        laser will be on.</p>
      <p><strong>Tracks</strong> can be switched <strong>every line, every
          frame or every stack</strong> (in case Z-stacks are acquired) (<b style="color: #ff6666;">T2</b>).
        Switching <strong>every line</strong> is the fastest and the images in
        individual Tracks are acquired nearly simultaneously. If there is any
        movement in the sample, the resulting shifts between channels would be
        minimal. On the other hand because of the requirement to switch the
        Tracks very fast, no mechanical movements of components are possible
        when switching. That limits the <strong>differences in settings between
          individual Tracks</strong> when switching every line. Permissible are
        for example switching on and off laser lines and switching on and off
        detection channels; prohibited are for example switching dichroics (here
        the multi-band dichroics come handy) or changing the detection ranges
        of&nbsp; individual channels. Being the fastest, switching every line is
        recommended unless not possible because e.g. each Track requires a
        different dichroic. When <strong>Z-stacks</strong> are acquired,
        switching tracks every stack is generally faster than switching every
        frame.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Tracks</strong> (and the <strong>Channels</strong>
        associated with them) are shown also in <a href="#ChannelPan">Channels
          panel</a> (<b style="color: #ffcc66;">C4</b>). The checkboxes allow
        you to switch Tracks on and off (e.g. when you want to focus or move the
        stage you would keep a single Track on to increase speed and/or prevent
        photobleaching of more sensitive fluorophores).</p>
      <h1 class="h1"><a id="Zstack" class="mozTocH1"></a>Z-stacks:</h1>
      <p><strong>Z-stacks</strong> are undoubtedly the most common of the more
        complex experiment types that can be selected in the upper part of the <a
          href="#Acquisition">Acquisition tab</a> (<strong style="color: #33ccff;">E3</strong>).
        The Z-stack is the defined in the Z-stack panel. You can define the
        stack by either selecting the <strong>first and last slice</strong> (<b
          style="color: red;">Z1</b>) or by selecting the <strong>central slice</strong>
        and defining the range. The latter approach is useful when using <a href="#Autofoc">autofocus</a>.
        In the first approach, focus to the plane where you want to start the
        stack (doesn't matter if it's the uppermost or the lowermost slice) and
        press <strong>Set First</strong> (<b style="color: red;">Z2</b>). Then
        focus to the last plane and press <strong>Set Last</strong> (<b style="color: red;">Z3</b>).
        To have the optimal spacing of slices based on the sectioning capability
        (the combination of the objective and pinhole size) press the suggested
        spacing (<b style="color: red;">Z4</b>). Start acquisition by pressing "<strong>Start

      <h1 class="h1"><a id="Spectral" class="mozTocH1"></a>Spectral imaging:</h1>
      <p>So far we have used only the <strong>Channel mode</strong> in <a href="#ImSetup">Imaging
          Setup</a> (<b style="color: #ff6600;">I0</b>). Lambda mode can be used
        to acquire spectral images leveraging the 32-element array of the
        spectral detector (<strong>ChS</strong>). A spectral image with spectral
        resolution of 8.9 nm (or multiples of it) can be acquired in a single
        scan. It is possible to acquire spectral images with higher spectral
        resolution; those however require sequential acquisition, one image per
        each wavelength.</p>
      <p>In <strong>Lambda mode</strong> with 8.9 nm spectral resolution, each
        of the 32 detectors forms a separate channel, thus providing up to
        32-channel image (for the full spectral range). The scanning settings
        are analogous to those in <a href="#Channels">Channel mode</a>. The
        spectral images can be visualized in spectral mode as a false-colour
        image where the signal from each of the 32 detectors is represented by a
        different colour. Spectra from a ROI in the image can be plotted in the
        <strong>Unmixing tab</strong>. As the name suggest, spectral unmixing
        can be performed to separate signals from fluorophores with overlapping
        spectra. Approach ABIF staff if you need assistance with spectral
        umixing.</p>

        thumbnail and icons indicating image type are shown. In this example we
        see a multi-channel (C) Z-stack and a spectral image (λ). The yellow
