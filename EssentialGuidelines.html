        <li>Users who have <strong>booked the microscope</strong> have a right
          to use the system within the booked time. Any other users using the
          microscope at the time have to stop their work without delay if a user
          who has booked the time asks them to do so. Users who find an <strong>unattended
            running experiment</strong> when they reach the microscope during
          their booked slot have the right to stop the experiment and sign the
          previous user out from the PC. Any <strong>loss of data</strong>
          resulting from such an action is the responsibility of the users who
          have left the experiment running unattended outside of their booked
          slot.</li>
        <li>If you encounter <strong>any issues</strong> with the microscope
          and/or PC, <strong>report them to NOBIC staff</strong> without delay
          e.g. by writing to <a href="javascript:decryptEmail%28%27bm9iaWMuZmFjaWxpdGllc0BlLm50dS5lZHUuc2c=%27%29;"><em>nobic.facilities[..]e.ntu.edu.sg</em></a>
          or by reporting an incident in <a href="https://ppms.asia/singascope/creatinc/?item=0"
            target="_blank">PPMS booking system</a>.</li>
        <li>If you are working with <strong>infectious materials</strong>, you
          need to verify that the fixation process has completely <strong>inactivated
            the infectious agent</strong>. When imaging <strong>live samples</strong>
          containing infectious agents, all sample carriers (culture dishes,
          multiwell plates, chambered slides, etc.) must have their <strong>lids
            sealed securely with parafilm</strong> to prevent spillage. <strong>Retroviral
            vectors</strong> used in the samples must be <strong>non-replicative</strong>.<img
            src="Media/Oil01.png" alt="" title="Oil on objective"></li>
        <li>If you are using oil immersion lenses, apply <strong>immersion oil
            in moderation</strong> to avoid it overflowing from the lens. Clean
          the lens with <strong>alcohol and lens tissue</strong> directly after
          use, <strong>before switching to another objective</strong>. <strong>Never
            let immersion oil stain a dry lens</strong>. If you suspect a dry
          lens got stained with oil, report it to NOBIC staff without delay.</li>
        <li>At the end of your session lower the nosepiece (on inverted
          microscope) or stage (on an upright microscope) to <strong>load
            position</strong> and engage a <strong>low-magnification lens</strong>.
          If you have been using <strong>CO<sub>2</sub></strong>, make sure the
          supply is <strong>closed</strong> properly. Close environmental
          enclosure (where applicable) and, if you are <strong>switching</strong>
          the microscope <strong>off</strong>, <strong>cover</strong> it with
          dust-cover (where applicable).</li>
        <li>Keep the microscope room <strong>clean and tidy</strong>. Take all
          your samples and other belongings with you when you leave. Samples
          left behind will be disposed of when found. Dispose of your waste
          properly (coverslips belong to sharp bins, ...) and observe general
          practices appropriate for a BSL-2 laboratory.</li>
        <img src="Media/PPMSSchedulePicture.PNG" alt="" title="PPMS Schedule">
        <li>Check the <strong>booking calendar</strong> at the end of your
          session (you can use the link at the desktop of all microscope PCs).
          If the next scheduled session starts in <strong>less than 1.5 hours</strong>,
          keep the system <strong>ON</strong>, otherwise switch it off.</li>
        <li>If you <strong>cancel</strong> your booked session <strong>less
            than 2 hours</strong> before the scheduled session start, make sure
          that the microscope <strong>does not stay switched on</strong>
          unnecessarily (especially not for an extended period of time, such as
          overnight or over the weekend) as a result of your cancelled session.</li>
        <li>If a <strong>microscope stays unnecessarily ON</strong> for an
          extended period of time as a result of your negligence (because you
          left it on despite no booked session following yours in &lt; 1.5 hours
          or because you have not shown up during your booked slot or because
          you cancelled your session and have not taken appropriate steps - <strong>see
            point 7</strong>), your group <strong>may be charged</strong> for
          the time the microscope was on as if it was your microscope usage.</li>
        <li>Save your data only to <strong>designated data folders</strong>.
          Data or other files stored elsewhere (e.g. Desktop, Downloads, ...)
          can be deleted without warning.</li>
        <li><strong>Copy your data</strong> to a network drive or repository as
          soon as possible, ideally directly at the end of your session. Data <strong>older
            than 30 days</strong> may be deleted from the microscope and image
          analysis workstations to maintain enough free disk space for new data
          acquisition/processing. NOBIC takes no responsibility for data stored
          at the microscope and image analysis workstations. </li>
