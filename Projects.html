          sub-picosecond tunable laser with operation wavelength range spanning
          795 – 1100 nm. The dual 920/1060 nm fixed-wavelength fiber laser allow

        <p> Conventional high resolution spectral / Fourier (SD / FD) Optical
          Coherence Tomography (OCT) typically performed at 800 nm achieves
          shallow penetration depths, mainly due to attenuation by absorption
          and scattering, thus are limited for superficial assessment of thick
          turbid media such as pharmaceutical tablets and biological tissues.
          Since the number of photons propagating unhindered (i.e., not
          scattered or absorbed) scales exponentially with the attenuation
          length (inverse of total attenuation coefficient of the tissue), the
          number of ballistic photons at the focal volume may drop to &lt; 0.7%
          even after propagation of only 5 attenuation lengths (about 0.6 mm at
          800 nm wavelength for biological tissue such as mouse brain). At the
          same time, the collection of multiply scattered light increases due to
          the high probability of forward scattering in biological tissue.
          Multiple scattering distorts the beam wavefront and prevents tight
          focusing when imaging deep, causing blurriness of the focused beam
          spot, and irreversibly degrades resolution, signal localization and
          contrast. The increased ratio of multiply scattered light to singly
          scattered light thus limits the imaging depth and spatial resolution
          of optical imaging techniques such as multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and
          OCT. Currently, most of the OCT or Optical Coherence Microscopy at
          1700 nm are limited by poor efficiency and significant chromatic
          aberrations due to lack of optical components optimized for this
          rarely used wavelength, thus greatly hampered achievable maximal
          sensitivity and overall imaging qualities. Furthermore, the
          sensitivity rolloff inherent to spectrometer-based OCT also
          effectively prevents utilization of whole imaging range afforded by
          the OCT system. Here, a novel Swept-source OCT employing all
          reflective optics will be developed to minimize optical and aberration
          loss, and negligible sensitivity rolloff to improve the penetration
          depths and spatial resolution when imaging deeply into turbid media. </p>

        <p> Remarkable progress in the manufacturing of opto-electronics lead to
          devices such as deformable mirrors or spatial light modulators, which
          offer a large degree of freedom in controlling the beam
          characteristics without any mechanically moving components.Specific
          arrangements of modulated beams enable coherent/incoherent
          superposition,parallelization or time-averaging. The liquid crystal on

        <p> The initial setup tests generating an arbitrary axial intensity
          distribution based on off-axis holography and Fourier optics. A
          fibre-coupled diode laser is collimated by an off-axis parabolic
          mirror and a polariszer generates a high polarisation ratio light
          beam. The laser beam then passes through a half wave plate which
          rotates its polarisation direction to fit well the ferroelectric
          liquid crystal SLM. We can get different intensity distributions
          around the fourier plane responding to different computer-generated
          patterns displayed on the SLM. Incoherent light sheet array will

          class="clear"> <br>
        </span>We are developing a custom microscope for confocal Brillouin and
        Raman micro-spectroscopy. Brillouin and Raman scattering are both
        non-elastic light scattering processes that can provide label-free image
        contrast in a variety of biological as well as material sciences
        samples. In Raman scattering, the photons exchange energy with molecular
        vibrational modes and the spectra contain qualitative as well as
        quantitative information on the chemical composition of the sample.
        Raman spectral fingerprints have proven a powerful tool for non-invasive
        microbial strain identification. In Brillouin scattering, the photons
        exchange energy with density waves (acoustic phonons) in the material
        under study. For homogeneous media, this information can be readily
        interpreted in terms of elastic moduli of the material. In this way,
        Brillouin spectroscopy is commonly employed in material science for
        non-invasive mechanical testing. However, in inhomogeneous systems such
        as any biological material, the interpretation of Brillouin spectra is
        much more complicated and a simple theoretical model is lacking.
        Therefore, Brillouin microscopy has not yet become widespread in
        biological and biomedical research, despite its high application
        potential in this field. <br>

          (Olympus, IX-71); it contains two lasers, 561 nm for Brillouin and
          Raman scattering and 488 nm for confocal fluorescence imaging. Raman
          spectra will be recorded by a custom-designed spectrograph with a CCD
          camera. The technical challenge in recording Brillouin spectra lies in
          the closeness of the Brillouin peaks to the peak of elastically
          scattered photons (Rayleigh peak), which is many orders of magnitude
          more intensive than the Brillouin peaks. This means that high spectral
          resolution together with efficient suppression of the Rayleigh peak
          are necessary. To meet this challenge, we use custom-designed

      <p class="project"> Raman fingerprinting combined with AI recognition of
        the spectra is a promissing approach to identify microbial strains. Our
        aim is to use this approach to identify selected bacterial and fungal
        strains related to biofilm formation on human skin.<br>

        <span class="clear"> <br>
        </span>We are using Raman microscpectroscopy to acquire Raman spectra of
        individual bacteria and measure their glycogen content. The bacterial
        strain under study is hypothesised to use glycogen as an energy reserve
        under unfavourable conditions. The measured spectra show clear changes
        in glycogen peaks depending on the conditions of the culture and allow
        us to study under which conditions is glycogen accumulated or consumed.<br>
