        field of lightsheet microscopy aim at further increasing the imaging

        direction and probing new concepts for lightsheet microscopy based on
        the use of adaptive optics to manipulate the coherence and spatial
        distribution of light. In this way for example Bessel beams (already
        well-established in lightsheet microscopy) can be produce; their
        "self-healing" properties allow for forming thin lightsheets over
        extended areas and make them more robust against scattering artefacts.<br>

        <p> Remarkable progress in the manufacturing of opto-electronics lead to
          devices such as deformable mirrors or spatial light modulators, which
          offer a large degree of freedom in controlling the beam
          characteristics without any mechanically moving components.Specific
          arrangements of modulated beams enable coherent/incoherent
          superposition,parallelization or time-averaging. The liquid crystal on
          silicon (LCoS) devices, we are using, allow us to shape the beam by

        <p> The initial setup tests generating an arbitrary axial intensity
          distribution based on off-axis holography and Fourier optics. A
          fibre-coupled diode laser is collimated by an off-axis parabolic
          mirror and a polariszer generates a high polarisation ratio light
          beam. The laser beam then passes through a half wave plate which
          rotates its polarisation direction to fit well the ferroelectric
          liquid crystal SLM. We can get different intensity distributions
          around the fourier plane responding to different computer-generated
          patterns displayed on the SLM. Incoherent light sheet array will

          class="clear"> <br>
        </span>We are developing a custom microscope for confocal Brillouin and
        Raman micro-spectroscopy. Brillouin and Raman scattering are both
        non-elastic light scattering processes that can provide label-free image
        contrast in a variety of biological as well as material sciences
        samples. In Raman scattering, the photons exchange energy with molecular
        vibrational modes and the spectra contain qualitative as well as
        quantitative information on the chemical composition of the sample.
        Raman spectral fingerprints have proven a powerful tool for non-invasive
        microbial strain identification. In Brillouin scattering, the photons
        exchange energy with density waves (acoustic phonons) in the material
        under study. For homogeneous media, this information can be readily
        interpreted in terms of elastic moduli of the material. In this way,
        Brillouin spectroscopy is commonly employed in material science for
        non-invasive mechanical testing. However, in inhomogeneous systems such
        as any biological material, the interpretation of Brillouin spectra is
        much more complicated and a simple theoretical model is lacking.
        Therefore, Brillouin microscopy has not yet become widespread in
        biological and biomedical research, despite its high application
        potential in this field. <br>

            P. et al. (2018) Nat Methods 15, 561–562</a>]. We aim to circumvent
          the ambiguities of Brillouin spectra of biological systems by

          </span>The microscope is built around a commercial inverted frame
          (Olympus, IX-71); it contains two lasers, 561 nm for Brillouin and
          Raman scattering and 488 nm for confocal fluorescence imaging. Raman
          spectra will be recorded by a custom-designed spectrograph with a CCD
          camera. The technical challenge in recording Brillouin spectra lies in
          the closeness of the Brillouin peaks to the peak of elastically
          scattered photons (Rayleigh peak), which is many orders of magnitude
          more intensive than the Brillouin peaks. This means that high spectral
          resolution together with efficient suppression of the Rayleigh peak
          are necessary. To meet this challenge, we use custom-designed
          common-path interferometric filters (two in a series) and a virtually
          imaged phase array (VIPA) spectrograph equipped with a scientific CMOS
          camera. The design is an improved version of a previously described
