      <h1 class="h1"><a id="ConfDet" class="mozTocH1"></a> Detection
        Configuration:</h1>
      <p>1. There are two types of detectors: standard <strong>photon-multiplier
          tubes</strong> (PMT) and <strong>hybrid detectors</strong> (HyD). The
        latter combine principles of PMTs with those of avalanche photodiodes
        and are superior to the standard PMTs in quantum efficiency. They are
        the detectors of choice especially for low-light applications.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/Channels.PNG" alt="" title="Detector setup">
      <p>The microscope is equipped with 3 HyDs and a PMT, allowing together for
        4 parallel fluorescence detection channels. There is one more detector,
        <strong>transmitted light PMT</strong>, which detects the laser light
        that has passed through the sample. It can be then used to create a
        brightfield or DIC (depending on the setting of the condenser <strong>[<span

            style="color: #8fc049;">A1</span>]</strong>) image of the sample.
        This image comes at no additional cost in terms of acquisition time or
        exposure of the sample to light and provides information complementary
        to the fluorescence channels.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Turn on the detectors</strong> you want to use and <strong>set
          up their spectral ranges</strong> <strong>[<span style="color: #8fc049;">A2</span>]</strong>
        (from the shortest to the longest wavelength as you go from detector 1
        to 4). You can display spectra of fluorophores <strong>[<span style="color: #8fc049;">A3</span>]</strong>
        from quite a large database in the plot above the detector panel and use
        them as guidelines for setting the spectral ranges.</p>
      <p>3. Set the <strong>gain of the PMTs [<span style="color: #8fc049;">A4</span>]</strong>
        - for fluorescence channels something from the range 500 - 800 V will
        usually provide good results (based on the fluorescence intensity); much
        lower gain is usually sufficient for PMT Trans.</p>
      <p>4. Set the <strong>operation mode of HyDs [<span style="color: #8fc049;">A5</span>]</strong>
        - you can select between <strong>Counting</strong> (the output is the
        number of detected photons) and Standard (output is the accumulated
        charge on the detector). Counting mode is advantageous especially for
        week signals, where it gives better signal-to-noise ratio. Do not use
        gain for HyDs, even in standard mode - it is not a real gain, just
        digital gain and as such brings no improvement to the images (you can
        easily multiply images by a constant larger than 1 in FIJI any time
        later), rather to the contrary (increased risk of image saturation). <strong>Counting
          mode</strong> offers one more option in conjunction with the WLL
        (pulsed at 80 MHz) - <strong>Gating</strong>. This means that we are
        collecting only photons coming within a certain part of the interval
        between two laser pulses (which is 12.5 ns); this can be used e.g. to
        suppress autofluorescence with very short fluorescence lifetime by
        rejecting photons detected shortly after the laser pulse (e.g. within
        the first 1 ns).</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/Gating.PNG" alt="" title="Gating">
      <p>5. Set the LUTs (colours) <strong>[<span style="color: #8fc049;">A6</span>]</strong>
        in which the images from individual detectors will be displayed.<br>
      </p>
      <p>6. All the fluorescence channels we have set up so far would be
        detected simultaneously. This is often not optimal because of spectral
        crosstalk between channels. E.g. in the example above most of the
        fluorophores shown would contribute to some extend to the subsequent
        channel and the extent can be quite large as seen for DAPI in the EGFP
        channel. In most cases this problem can be alleviated by not exciting
        all fluorophores simultaneously but one at a time. This can be set up
        using <strong>Sequential scan</strong>. Go to Acquisition Mode
        selection in the left-hand side container (we'll talk about it a few
        more times later) and select SEQ. <strong>[<span style="color: #498fc0;">B1</span>]</strong>.</p>
      <a name="Modes" id="Modes" class="anchor"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/AcqMode.png"

        alt="" title="Acquisition Mode">
      <p>A <strong>Sequential scan</strong> panel will be added to the bottom
        of the left-hand side container. In each sequence you can select what
        lasers and detectors will be on simultaneously. E.g. in sequence 1: 405
        nm laser and HyD 1 and PMT Trans, in sequence 2: 488 nm line of the WLL
        and PMT 2, and so on. You can also select whether to switch between the
        sequences after every line, every frame or every stack. <strong>Switching
          after every line is the fastest</strong> and all sequences (that means
        all fluorescence channels) are acquired almost simultaneously. To allow
        fast switching after every line scanned, only certain differences
        between the sequences are permitted (e.g. <strong>switching on/off of
          detectors, changing laser line powers</strong> are allowed; changing
        detector spectral ranges or switching on/off lasers are not allowed).
        Note that while you can't switch on/off lasers when switching sequences
        between lines, you can still set laser lines to 0% power.</p>

        playing the role of the major dichroic) configuration <strong>[<span style="color: #8fc049;">A7</span>]
        </strong>allow toggling between fluorescence detection mode (AOBS does
        not transmit the excitation wavelength, default) and reflected light
        imaging mode for each active laser line.</p>

      <br>
      <h1 class="h1"><a id="ConfScan" class="mozTocH1"></a> Scanning
        Configuration:</h1>
      <p> 1. We'll move now to the left-hand side container below the
        Acquisition Mode to configure how is the image scanned. We need to
        define the <strong>scanning speed</strong> (lines/s) <strong>[<span style="color: #cc9933;">C1</span>]</strong>,
        size of the scanned area (<strong>Zoom Factor</strong>) <strong>[<span

            style="color: #cc9933;">C2</span>]</strong> and <strong>sampling</strong>
        of the image (Format - into how many pixels will the scanned image be
        divided) <strong>[<span style="color: #cc9933;">C3</span>]</strong>.
        Note that the smallest zoom factor is smaller than 1 (the largest
        possible scanned area; consider zoom factor 1 as the smallest
        recommended zoom (largest recommended area) in terms of maximising image
        uniformity and minimising aberrations. Also note that the maximum
        scanned area is reduced at higher scanning speeds.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/Scan.png" alt="" title="Scan settings">
      <p> 2. The <strong>sampling</strong> is a very important setting as
        pixels which are too large (too few pixels) will limit the resolution of
        the image (pixelated image). On the other hand too high number of pixels
        (too small pixels) will either increase the acquisition time and reduce
        the pixel dwell time (compromising signal-to-noise ratio). <strong>The
          optimal (Nyquist) sampling</strong> is such that the pixel is slightly
        smaller than a half of the theoretical optical resolution limit. You can
        set it automatically by pressing Optimize XY Format <strong>[<span style="color: #cc9933;">C4</span>]</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>3. Scanning speed can be increased twice by using <strong>Bidirectional
          scan [<span style="color: #cc9933;">C5</span>]</strong>. Scan
        artefacts (odd and even lines are shifted with respect to each other)
        can appear, especially at high zoom factors and fast scanning.
        Corrections for that can be set (the sliders for Phase X and Y will
        appear when Bidirectional scan is on). This is an area recommended only
        for adventurous users.</p>
      <p>4. Lines or frames can be scanned repeatedly and the signal <strong>accumulated
          or averaged [<span style="color: #cc9933;">C6</span>]</strong>.
        Accumulation is preferable for very low signals in counting mode (on the
        level of single photons/pixel). Averaging is preferable for higher
        signals (avoids exceeding the dynamic range and averages out noise). See
        here for a <a href="#FastScan">discussion</a> on whether to scan once
        at a slower speed or repeatedly at higher speed.</p>
      <p>5. <strong>Pinhole</strong> size is crucial in confocal imaging and
        it's rather weird its setting is hidden from the first view <strong>[<span

            style="color: #cc9933;">C7</span>]</strong>. The usual trade-off
        between resolution and signal is <strong>1Airy unit (AU)</strong>. Note
        that <strong>AU is wavelength dependent</strong>.</p>

        small steps in arbitrary direction <strong>[<span style="color: #cc9933;">C9</span>]</strong>
        or rotating the scanned area<strong> [<span style="color: #cc9933;">C10</span>]</strong>.</p>

        loading it and focusing it). See live image by pressing <strong>Live </strong>in
        the bottom bar of the software window (Live acquisition doesn't involve

                <li>A single slower scan will result in the same total time for
                  which the signal in each pixel is accumulated as repeated
                  faster scans - is there any practical difference between the
                  two scenarios?</li>
                <li><strong>Repeated faster scanning is considered gentler for
                    live samples</strong> - the cell has time to recover and
                  mitigate any photo-induced oxidative stress before the laser
                  beams returns to the same spot.</li>
                <li>Extremely fast scanning (such as with <strong>resonant
                    scanners</strong>) makes difference even for non-living
                  samples. The pixel dwell time is shorter than the fluorophore
                  dark state saturation time. Fluorophores do not have time to
                  fully populate their dark states and thus their brightness is
                  transiently higher.</li>
                <li>This can be demonstrated on a fixed sample image. Both
                  images have the same scaling, and nearly identical total
                  acquisition time (the one for the resonant scanner is even
                  marginally shorter).<br>

      <p> 1. Z-stacks are the staple of confocal imaging and can be set in the
        default mode in a panel in the left-hand side container below the
        scanning configuration.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/Z-stack.PNG" alt="" title="Z-stack"><br>
      <p>2. Focus to the lowermost plane you want to acquire and press Begin <strong>[<span

            style="color: #c0498f;">E1</span>]</strong>, then to the uppermost
        plane and press End <strong>[<span style="color: #c0498f;">E2</span>]</strong>
        (or vice versa depending on the stack orientation <strong>[<span style="color: #c0498f;">E3</span>]</strong>).
        You can set the step manually or used the System Optimized step <strong>[<span

            style="color: #c0498f;">E4</span>]</strong> (similar to optimising
        the XY sampling). Scanning can be performed either by the galvo-stage (<strong>z-Galvo</strong>)
        <strong>[<span style="color: #c0498f;">E5</span>]</strong> or by the
        objective focus drive (z-Wide). The galvo is faster and more accurate,
        but has a limited range compared to the focus drive.</p>
      <p>3. Acquire the stack by pressing <strong>Start</strong> in the bottom
        bar of the software window.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h1 class="h1"><a id="ConfPos" class="mozTocH1"></a> Multi-position:</h1>
      <p>1. There are two basic types of multi-position acquisitions:
        large-field scans (moving the stage is used to capture an image of a
        continuous area larger than the maximum area accessible to the scanner)
        and acquisitions at discreet positions (useful in combination with
        time-lapse acquisition when multiple location in the sample can be
        revisited at each time point. Either of these two can be selected in the
        <a href="#Modes">Acquisition Mode</a> (the former <strong>[<span style="color: #498fc0;">B2</span>]</strong>
        and the latter as <strong>[<span style="color: #498fc0;">B3</span>]</strong>).</p>
      <p>2. The large field (in the example shown it is 5x5 scanner fields of
        view) can be used to acquire a preview map of the sample (e.g. in one
        channel only) and then to navigate the stage to locations of interest
        e.g. for high-resolution multi-channel scanning.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/Stage1.PNG" alt="" title="Stage overview">
      <p>3. In the latter mode, a list of discreet stage positions can be
        created by finding areas of interest in the sample and adding their
        stage coordinates to the list.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/Stage2.PNG" alt="" title="Positions"><br>
      <br>
      <h1 class="h1"><a id="ConfOtherM" class="mozTocH1"></a> Time-lapse & Other Acquisition
        Modes:</h1>
      <p> 1. So far we have used only the default mode which is <strong>XYZ</strong>.
        However, other modes are available in the drop-down menu in Acquisition
        Modes:</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/modes.png" alt="" title="Acquisition Modes">
      <p> <a name="galvo" id="galvo" class="anchor"></a>2. A slightly different
        mode is <strong>XZY</strong>, in which the scanning is done primarily
        in a vertical plane (XZ) and the other horizontal coordinate is the
        slowest direction. This is interesting if you are interested mainly in
        the vertical cross section of the sample. It is possible by using the
        fast galvo-stage which moves the sample in the vertical direction. When
        oscillating, the stage may produce <strong>high-frequency sound</strong>.
        Sometimes this sound is present if the stage is not scanning (in XYZ
        mode) because the stage is not well balanced and keeps compensating for
        any mechanical drifts. Switching between XZY and XYZ modes helps the
        stage to stabilise.</p>
      <p>3. There are also different modes of <strong>spectral scans</strong>
        for spectral imaging either in the emission spectra (lower-case lambda)
        or excitation spectra domain (capital lambda - using the WLL). An
        example of setting up an emission spectra scan (in the range from 410 nm
        to 780 nm and 10 nm spectral resolution, using deterctor HyD 1) is shown
        below: </p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/lambda2.PNG" alt="" title="Spectral scan"> <img

        src="Media/Manuals/Leica/lambda1.PNG" alt="" title="Spectral scan_detection"><br>
      <p>The spectrum can be visualised in Quantify tab (as Stack profile). If
        the spectrum appears too small, right click in the plot area and select
        "Normalize". If no ROI is selected the spectrum corresponds to the whole
        image; by selecting ROIs, spectra of different parts of the image can be
        extracted.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/Leica/spectrum.PNG" alt="" title="Spectrum">
      <p>4. A straightforward extension of any of the acquisition modes is including
        the <b>temporal dimension</b> (e.g. XYZt). Below is shown an example of setting
        up a time-lapse of 100 time points with approximately half a minute
        interval.</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><a id="ConfAFC" class="mozTocH1"></a> Using Hardware
        Autofocus:</h1>
      <p> 1. The microscope is equipped with an IR-laser based hardware
        autofocus (<strong>A</strong>daptive <strong>F</strong>ocus <strong>C</strong>ontrol).
        Open the autofocus dialogue in <a href="#Modes">Acquisition Modes</a> <strong>[<span

            style="color: #498fc0;">B4</span>]</strong>. AFC has two mode of
        operation - <strong>continuous</strong> (locks the current focus and
        holds it - suitable for very fast time-lapses at a single spot) and <strong>on
          demand</strong> (refocuses before taking and image, suitable for
        multi-position experiments). The on-demand mode allows you to select if
        the focusing should be done for each time point and/or each position or
        for every n-th time point/position only. If you acquire a Z-stack at
        each time point and/or position, AFC will maintain the focusing of the
        central slice of the stack.</p>

      <p> 1. Images are saved in <strong>.LIF</strong> format; each .LIF file
        is an envelope file for a whole project which may contain an arbitrary
        number of images of arbitrary types. To setup the path for saving, go to
        <strong>Projects tab</strong> in the left-hand side container.</p>
