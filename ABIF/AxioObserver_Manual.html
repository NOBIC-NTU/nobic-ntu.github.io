      <h1 class="h1">Transmitted light imaging:</h1>
      <p>A simple transmitted light imaging experiment can be set up in the <b>
          Locate tab</b>. In general, the Locate tab allows you to set any
        simple imaging experiment; however, for more complex automated
        acquisition modes such as <a href="#mozTocId459397">multi-channel</a>
        or <a href="#mozTocId302345">multi-position</a> imaging, we need to go
        to the <strong>Acquisition tab</strong> as we will discuss later.</p>
      <p>There are two panels in the Locate tab: <strong>Light Path</strong>
        and <a href="#Camera">Camera</a>. Let us look at the <strong>Light
          Path</strong> first. The panel displays a diagram of microscope parts
        in a topology corresponding to their physical locations (what is on top
        in the diagram is on top in reality).</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObsZ1/TL_Locate.PNG" alt="" title="LightPath-TL"></p>
      The transmitted light arm is almost fully controlled by the software and
      consists of a halogen <a href="#lamp">lamp</a> (<b>1</b>), shutter (<strong>2</strong>),
      <a href="#field"> field-stop</a> (<b style="color: #c0498f;">3</b>, not
      included in the diagram, since that is the only manual component in the
      path, see the <a href="#condenser_im">image</a> below) and <a href="#condenser">condenser</a>
      (<b>4</b>). Clicking at the arrow in the lower right-hand side corner of
      the respective box opens a dialogue with settings. The <b>shutter</b> (<b>2</b>)
      is an exception as it is only toggled between two states (open/closed) by
      clicking the box.
      <p><a class="anchor" name="lamp" id="lamp"></a>The voltage of the <b>lamp</b>
        (<strong>1</strong>) can be set - it changes the intensity of the light
        as well as its hue (lower voltage gives "warmer" hue, with higher
        representation of the red side of the spectrum).</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="field" id="field"></a>The <a href="#condenser_im"><b>field
            stop</b></a> (<strong style="color: #c0498f;">3</strong>) defines
        the illuminated area, this is used when setting <a href="#Koehler">Koehler
          illumination</a>.</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="condenser" id="condenser"></a>The <strong>condenser</strong>
        (<strong>4</strong>) settings dialogue contains selection of the <strong>mode
          of contrast</strong> (brightfield, phase contrast or DIC). <strong>Phase
          contrast</strong> requires specialised objectives, check the <a href="CZ_Axio_Observer_Z1.html"

          title="AxioObserver_overview">system overview</a> to find which
        objectives support phase contrast. Alternatively this information can be
        found from objective details displayed at the <strong>touchscreen panel</strong>.
        For phase contrast, the objective needs to be matched with the correct
        phase ring (Ph1, Ph2 or Ph3).</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" id="Touchpanel"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/Zeiss_Touchpanel.jpg"

          alt="" title="Touchscreen panel-Obj. details"></p>
      <p> <a class="anchor" id="CondSettings_Im"></a> <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObsZ1/Condenser.png"

          alt="" title="Condenser_settings"> </p>
      <p>For <strong>DIC</strong>, the objective has to be matched with the
        correct prism in the condenser (see the details at the <strong>touchscreen
          panel</strong>) and a second prism needs to inserted in the slot under
        the objective (by default the prisms are there, do not remove them
        without consulting ABIF staff).</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObsZ1/DIC_prism.jpg" alt="" title="DIC_prism">
      <p>The <strong>numerical aperture</strong> of the condenser can be also
        set here. This influences the intensity of the light at sample as well
        as the contrast and resolution of the images. For <strong>brightfield</strong>
        the rule of thumb is: <em>Condenser NA = 1/2 Objective NA</em>. For <strong>phase
          contrast</strong><strong></strong>, the highest available condenser <em>NA</em>
        is usually selected.</p>
      <p>The current condenser <strong>contrast mode/<em>NA</em></strong> is
        also displayed at the <a href="#Touchpanel">touchscreen panel</a>
        (status bar at the bottom, brightfield (BF)/<em>NA</em> = 0.9 in the
        example).</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="downstream" id="downstream"></a>Other
        components are common for the transmitted light and fluorescence paths;
        they are the <strong>objective revolver</strong> (<strong>5</strong>),
        the motorised <strong>filter cube turret</strong> (<strong>6</strong>),
        the <a href="#tubelens">tube lens</a> (<strong>7</strong>) and the <a

          href="#phototube">intermediate phototube</a><strong> </strong>(<strong>8</strong>).</p>
      <p>For transmitted light we don't need a filter, so we select the empty
        position with <strong>analyser</strong> (needed for DIC and not
        disturbing the other contrast methods).</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="tubelens" id="tubelens"></a>The <strong>tube
          lens</strong> turret (<strong>7</strong>) has three positions: 1x
        magnification, 1.6x magnification (in this case the overall image
        magnification is <em>1.6 x Objective magnification</em>) and an empty
        position (do not select that one).</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="phototube" id="phototube"></a>The <strong>intermediate
          phototube </strong>(<strong>8</strong>) selects whether all light
        will go to the eyepiece or whether it will divided between the eyepiece
        and the camera port in 20/80 ratio.</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="Camera" id="Camera"></a>Next we'll have a look
        at the <strong>Camera</strong> panel. The only parameter here to set is
        the <b>exposure time</b>. For brightfiled it can be usually quite short
        (order of ms usually); for phase contrast and darkfield, longer exposure
        and/or higher <a href="#lamp">lamp voltage</a> are typically needed.
        The exposure time can be optimised automatically by pressing <strong>Set
          Exposure</strong>. See notes on <a href="#Histogram">optimising image
          intensity</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If <strong>Auto Exposure</strong> option is
        checked, the exposure time will be automatically optimised for each
        image frame captured which may result in varying exposure times within a
        series of images.</p>
      <p>Note that the camera is <strong>grey scale</strong> only. If you need
        to take transmitted light images in <strong>colour</strong>, you can
        use the following <a href="#RGBrightfield">trick</a> using
        multi-channel acquisition.</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Camera_settingTL.PNG" alt="" title="Camera_TL"><br>
      </p>
      <p>This is all for the settings. If we have loaded a sample, we can view
        it in the eyepieces or on the screen using live camera image -&nbsp; <strong>Live</strong>
        (<strong>9</strong>) or <strong>Continuous</strong> (<strong>10</strong>),
        and focus the sample by turning the <strong>focusing knob</strong>
        (located on the sides of the microscope body as well as on the side of
        the touchscreen panel). Once the sample is in focus, we can take static
        images by pressing <strong>Snap </strong>(<strong>11</strong>). See
        notes on <a href="#Histogram">adjusting the display</a> of images in
        ZEN.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObsZ1/Locate_PathTL2.png" alt="" title="Left-container-top">
      <p>We can toggle the objective position between the<strong> Load position</strong>

      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId40676" class="mozTocH1"></a>Fluorescence
        imaging:</h1>
      <p><b>Locate tab</b> can be used for simple fluorescence imaging; however,
        for more complex automated acquisition modes such as <a href="#mozTocId459397">multi-channel</a>
        or <a href="#mozTocId302345">multi-position</a> imaging, we need to go
        to the <strong>Acquisition tab</strong> as we will discuss later.</p>
      <p>Let's start again with the <strong>Light Path</strong> panel. The
        fluorescence illumination arm is fully motorised. It consists of the <strong>epifluorescence
          lamp</strong> (<strong>1</strong>, not controlled by the software), <b>shutter</b>
        (<strong>2</strong>, note that there appear two shutters in the diagram,
        however only the left-hand side box, highlighted, corresponds to an
        actual shutter, closing the other one does not stop the light from
        reaching the objective), the <a href="#attenuator">attenuator</a> (<b>3</b>)
        and the <a href="#FLfield">field stop</a> (<b>4</b>). The<b> filter
          cube</b> (<b>5</b>) has to be selected to match the fluorophore of
        interest. Other motorised components are the same as for the <a href="#downstream">
          transmitted light path</a>.</p>
      <a class="anchor" id="locate"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObsZ1/FL_Locate.PNG"

        alt="" title="Locate-fluor">
      <p><a class="anchor" name="attenuator" id="attenuator"></a>The <b>attenuator
          wheel</b> (<b>3</b>) reduces the excitation intensity reaching the
        sample - the setting is in percentage of the full intensity (for the
        actual intensities refer to the <a href="PDFs/Zeiss_WFinv_intensity.pdf">table</a>).</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="FLfield" id="FLfield"></a>The <strong>field
          stop</strong> (<strong>4</strong>) determines the field of view
        analogously to the <a href="#field">field stop</a> in transmitted light
        imaging.</p>
      <p>Next we'll need to set the camera <b>exposure time</b> in the <a href="#Camera">Camera
          panel</a>. For fluorescence it is usually on the order of 100 ms. This
        is all for the settings and we can view the live image by pressing <strong>Live</strong>
        or <strong>Continuous</strong> or take static images by pressing <strong>Snap</strong>.
        The exposure time can be optimised automatically by pressing <strong>Set
          Exposure</strong>. See notes on <a href="#Histogram">adjusting the
          display</a> of images in ZEN.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Never check <strong>Auto Exposure</strong> if
        you want to compare fluorescence intensity between images. For <strong>comparing
          intensities </strong>it is critical to<strong> acquire the images
          with identical settings</strong>, including identical exposure times.
        Auto Exposure can also result in <strong>impractically long exposure
          times</strong> when the imaged part of the sample exhibits no or
        extremely low fluorescence (e.g. when acquiring a <a href="#mozTocId302345">Tile-scan</a>
        including regions lacking fluorescent structures).</p>
      <p><strong>Note: I</strong>f you've set a long exposure time, it will not
        be reflected in <strong>Live</strong> mode since it's intended for
        purposes such as focusing or stage movement where a fast refresh rate of
        the live image is desirable.</p>
      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId459397" class="mozTocH1"></a>Multi-channel
        imaging:</h1>
      <p>For more complex imaging scenarios, we need to move to the <strong>Acquisition
          tab</strong>, where we can set up acquisition of <a href="#mozTocId459397">multi-channel
          images</a>, <a href="#mozTocId401036">Z-stacks</a>, <a href="#mozTocId302345">multi-position
          images</a>, or <a href="#mozTocId21557">time-lapse acquisition</a>
        (and, of course, arbitrary combinations of those).</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> the lastly used multi-channel setting may be
        loaded automatically. To setup your own setting from the beginning,
        create a <strong>new setting</strong> in <a href="#mozTocId115980">Experiment
          Manager</a>.</p>
      <p>To set up a multi-channel acquisition, press the <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Acquire_AddChannel+.png"

          alt="" title="Add Channel+"> button in the <strong>Channels panel</strong>.
        A window with a selection of fluorescent dyes will pop up, where you can
        select and add dyes identical or close to those in your sample.
        Different transmitted light contrast modes can be added as well.</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Acquire_AddChannel1a.png" alt="" title="Add Channel">
        <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Acquire_AddChannel1b.png" alt="" title="Add Channel-pop up"></p>
      <p>Note that the selection is vastly redundant, since the number of actual
        settings for fluorescence is limited by the number of filter cubes. The
        program thus matches each fluorophore with the best match from the
        available cubes.</p>
      <p>Let us for example select a blue fluorophore such as DAPI, a red
        fluorophore such as DsRed and Brightfield. The C<strong>hannels panel</strong>
        can than look something like this: </p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="channels" id="channels"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Acquire_AddChannel2.PNG"

          alt="" title="Channels panel"></p>
      <p>By a right click on the name of the fluorophore, we can <strong>rename
          the channel</strong> (e.g. if our exact fuorophore is not in the list
        and we've selected a spectrally similar one instead). In this example
        I've renamed DAPI to BlueDye and DsRed to RedDye. You can also change
        the <strong>colour </strong>in which the images for individual channel
        will be displayed (small square to the right of the channel name).</p>
      <p>Left click on a channel selects the channel. In the example shown,
        RedDye is selected. The selected channel will be displayed in live mode
        by pressing <strong>Live</strong>. I can also set the <strong>exposure
          time</strong> for the selected channel (each channel can have
        different exposure, see notes on <a href="#Histogram">setting the exposure</a>) and modify the <strong>Light Path</strong>.
        The only difference from setting the <strong>Light Path</strong> in <a

          href="#locate">Locate tab</a> is the presence of check boxes at each
        component. Those indicate whether the settings for the given component
        will be a part of the channel settings. In the example shown, the field
        stop is unchecked. That means that the current opening of the field stop
        (74%) will be used for the acquisition of the channel. If this box is
        unchecked for all channels, they will be imaged with the same filed stop
        opening. On the other hand, if I check the box, I can set a different
        value for each channel.</p>

                <li>This effect can be compensated in multi-channel acquisition
                  by introducing offsets between the focus position for each
                  channel.</li>
                <li>To find the offsets you need a sample with thin objects that
                  are visible in all channels of interest. Otherwise your
                  offsets may compensate for different axial distribution of
                  different fluorophores rather than for the chromatic
                  aberration.</li>
                <li>One channel is selected as reference (DAPI channel in this
                  example); focus manually using the live image for this
                  channel. Note the focus <strong>Z-position</strong>
                  (displayed for example on the <a href="#Touchpanel">touchscreen

                <li>Then switch to another channel (e.g. DsRed) and refocus to

                  calculate its difference from the reference channel focus
                  position. Input this value to the <strong>Focus Offset Z</strong>

      <p>By pressing <strong>Snap</strong>, we take an image with all selected
        channels (those that are checked in the <a href="#channels">Channels
          panel</a> - checkbox is to the left of the channel name). The image
        can be displayed as an overlay of all channels (2D) or as a split view.</p>
      <p>There are two panels below the image display. Let's look at the
        left-hand side one:</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="Dimensions" id="Dimensions"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Fluor_2D_dim.png"

          alt="" title="2D-dimensions"><br>
      </p>
      <p>The control in the panel allow us to <strong>zoom in and out</strong>
        and select which channels are displayed (only the two fluorescence
        channels are displayed in the example, brightfield display is switched
        off). The <strong>Graphics</strong> tab (currently hidden) allows to
        add objects such as a <strong>scale bar</strong> to the image.</p>
      <p>The right-hand side panel shows the image histogram discussed in the
        following box:</p>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <td><a class="anchor" name="Histogram" id="Histogram"></a> Image
              histogram: </td>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Image histogram shows the distribution of pixel intensities
                  in the image. The horizontal axis shows the intensities; its
                  range corresponds to the dynamic range of the camera image.
                  The vertical axis shows the number of pixels with a given
                  intensity.</li>
                <li>The histogram is useful in optimising imaging settings, such
                  as camera exposure. Histogram reaching the highest intensity
                  values indicates that the exposure is too long or excitation
                  intensity too high. Pixels having the highest intensity value
                  are potentially <strong>saturated pixels</strong> - they
                  correspond to pixels with fluorescence intensities exceeding
                  the dynamic range. On the other, histogram crouching at the
                  low intensities end shows that the dynamic range is not
                  optimally utilised, which likely compromises the image
                  quality. A longer exposure would likely help.</li>
                <li>For a multi-channel image, histograms for all channels are
                  shown together with lines indicating the <strong>scaling of
                    the image</strong> display for each channel (below what
                  intensity value pixels are displayed in black and above what
                  intensity value the pixels are displayed in maximum
                  brightness). Adjusting the display scaling helps to visualise
                  channels with different intensities.</li>
                <li><strong>Best Fit</strong> is meant to optimise the image
                  scaling for the best possible display. The result is not
                  necessarily always the best possible. <strong>Min/Max</strong>&nbsp;
                  stretches the scaling between the lowest and the highest pixel
                  intensity for a given channel.<br>

                  &nbsp; </li>
                <li>Note that the changes in the <strong>scaling do not modify
                    the image itself</strong>, only the way it is currently
                  displayed. It will therefore not alter the way the image is
                  displayed the next time it is opened.</li>

        acquisition:</h1>
      <p>To acquire a stack of images at different Z-planes check Z-stack
        option:</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Z-stack.PNG" alt="" title="Z-stack"></p>
      <p>Z-stack panel will be added to the settings panels in the left-hand
        side container. To define a stack, focus to the lowest plane you want to
        acquire and press:<strong> Set First</strong>. Then focus to the
        uppermost plane and press <strong>Set Last</strong>. The number of
        slices in the stack is determined by the range and the interval between
        slices. Interval that satisfies Nyquist sampling for the axial
        resolution of the selected objective is suggested as <strong>Optimal </strong>(1.45
        μm in the example shown). </p>
      <p>Once the stack is set, start the acquisition by pressing <strong>Start
          Experiment</strong>. The stack will be recorded for all channels
        checked in the <a href="#channels">Channels panel</a>.</p>
      <p>Z-stack can be then viewed by individual planes, as orthogonal sections
        or as 3D rendering (see the tabs to the left of the displayed image).</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Z-stack2.PNG" alt="" title="Z-stack view">
      <p>Alternatively, Z-stack can be set up by selecting the <strong>central
          plane</strong> and the range (centre +/- half of the range). This
        option is unlocked by selecting&nbsp;<img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObsZ1/SelectAll.png"

          alt="" title="Show All"> for <strong>Z-stack panel</strong>. Focus to
        the central plane, confirm it as the centre of the stack by pressing <strong>Center</strong>

      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId302345" class="mozTocH1"></a>Multi-position
        imaging:</h1>
      <p>The motorised stage can be used to set a few types of multi-position
        imaging experiments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tiles</strong> scan - acquire an image larger than the field
          of view of the camera by stitching together multiple images acquired
          at neighbouring positions.</li>
        <li><strong>Positions</strong> - remembers a list of selected stage
          positions, which can be then imaged repeatedly. This makes sense
          mainly in combination with time-lapse imaging, when it allows to
          monitor in time multiple locations within the sample.</li>
        <li><strong>Sample-carrier</strong>-specific position grids - for
          standard sample carriers such as a 96-well plates allows setting up
          easily acquisition at a regular positions grid (e.g. each well of the
          plate).</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Check the <strong>Tiles</strong> option and a Tiles panel will be
        added:</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Tiles_1.PNG" alt="" title="Multi-positions">
      <p>The upper part of the panel allows defining the <strong>Tile scan</strong>
        - in the example shown the scan will cover a field of 2x2 fields of
        view, by pressing the&nbsp;<img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/TilesArrow_1.png"

          alt="" title="tiles-arrow2"> button it is added to the list of Tile
        scan regions (multiple regions can be defined and then all of them
        imaged).</p>
      <p>If you are imaging a single large object (e.g. a tissue section) and
        want to make sure that you capture the whole object, select <strong>Stake</strong>
        option. You will then move the stage to several positions at the
        boundaries of the object and store those positions (called <strong>Markers</strong>
        in this context). The program will then set the tiles regions in such a
        way that it contains all the stored positions.</p>
      <p>Acquisition at a set of discreet positions can be set in the lower part
        of the Tiles panel. Move the stage to the desired position and press <img

          src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/TilesArrow_2.png" alt="" title="tiles-arow2">.
        The position will be stored in the list of positions. Repeat this step
        for all other positions to populate a list of arbitrary positions.
        Another option is to select a <strong>Sample carrier</strong> from the
        list (e.g. 96-well plate). Then press <strong>Calibrate...</strong> and
        you will be prompted to move the stage to selected reference wells.
        Based on those reference positions, the program will calculate the grid
        of positions of all wells in the plate allowing setting up an automated
        acquisition in all (or selected) wells of the plate.</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId21557" class="mozTocH1"></a>Time-lapse
        imaging:</h1>
      <p>Setting up a time-lapse acquisition is very straightforward. Check the
        Time series option and a Time Series panel will be added. You can set
        the number of time points to be acquired (100 in the example) and the
        interval between them (5 min. in the example). If you want to acquire
        images with the maximum temporal resolution possible, set the interval
        to zero and check the option "Use Camera Streaming if Possible". Start
        acquisition for all selected channels by pressing Start Experiment.</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/TimeSeries.PNG" alt="" title="timelapse"></p>
      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId528749" class="mozTocH1"></a>Saving images:</h1>
      <p>Acquired images are listed in the image explorer panel at the
        right-hand side of ZEN window. For each image the name, size, thumbnail
        and icons indicating image type are shown. In this example we see a
        multi-channel image (C), a multi-channel Z-stack and a multi-channel
        Tile-scan. Image (selected by clicking on it) can be saved by clicking
        the <strong>floppy-disk button</strong> (highlighted for the benefit of
        younger users not familiar with the early history of data storage). </p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Save.PNG" alt="" title="saving">
      <p>This is not very convenient for saving large numbers of images. If you
        want to acquire many images, it is useful to set up <strong>Autosave</strong>
        option in a dedicated panel in the settings area on the left-hand side.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Autosave.PNG" alt="" title="autosave">
      <p>Select a folder for your images at one of the data drives (D: to G:).
        ZEN will automatically create a subfolder there named according to the
        current date. Set a base name for your images - all images will then
        have the name with a number differentiating individual images.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The images you see open in ZEN (in the image
        explorer panel) are not the ones that is saved to disk by autosave. Any
        changes to the images after acquisition (e.g. adding scale bars) do not
        modify the autosaved images and the modified images need to be saved
        separately.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Autosave</strong> applies only to
        images acquired under the <strong>Acquisition tab</strong>. Images
        Acquired in the Locate tab by pressing Snap, are not saved
        automatically.</p>
      <p>When <strong>closing ZEN</strong>, a window will appear with the list
        of modified files asking whether they should be saved. Do not be
        disturbed if all images appear there as unsaved when you are using
        autosave - that does not mean that the autosave is not working (see the
        note above). Besides images, the list also contains all <a href="#mozTocId115980">Experiment
          Manager</a> files that have been opened during the session. You can
        uncheck all and not save any changes if you have saved all your images
        (e.g. by Autosave). Note that saving any images in this way saves them
        to a default image location rather than letting you choose the
        destination.</p>
      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId115980" class="mozTocH1"></a>Saving imaging
        settings:</h1>
      <p>Acquisition settings can be saved for future use in <strong>Experiment
          Manager</strong> (select Save As and give the settings a name by which
        you can later recognise the file; ideally include your name to make it
        clear whose settings those are). In the example settings file called
        Experiment is open; other settings files can be chosen from a drop-down
        list.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/ExperimentManager.png" alt="" title="Experiment manager">
