      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId883288" class="mozTocH1"></a>Transmitted
        light imaging:</h1>
      <p>A simple transmitted light imaging experiment can be set up in the <b>
          Locate tab</b>. In general, the Locate tab allows you to set any
        simple imaging experiment; however, for more complex automated
        acquisition modes such as <a href="#mozTocId207084">multi-channel</a>
        or <a href="#mozTocId302345">multi-position</a> imaging, we need to go
        to the <strong>Acqusition tab</strong> as we will discuss later.</p>
      <p>There are two panels in the Locate tab: <strong>Light Path</strong>
        and <a href="#Camera">Camera</a>. Let us look at the <strong>Light
          Path</strong> first. The panel displays a diagram of microscope parts
        in a topology corresponding to their physical locations (what is on top
        in the diagram is on top in reality).</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Locate_PathTL.PNG" alt="" title="Locate_LightPathTL"></p>
      <p>Some of the boxes in the diagram have small symbols in their lower
        left-hand side corners. A <b>hand symbol</b> indicates a manually
        controlled component - it has to be adjusted manually and the software
        has no feedback about its state. Pop-up windows may appear to warn you
        to check the manual components before you start image acquisition. An
        example is the mirror which directs the image either to the eyepiece or
        to the camera (<b>1</b>) and is controlled by a manual lever:</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/AxioImager_lever.jpg" alt="" title="AxioIm-Tube-lever"><br>
      </p>
      <p>The symbol ⓘ in the objective box (<strong>2</strong>) indicates a
        manual but registered component - you need to turn the objective
        revolver manually but the software receives feedback on its current
        position. Boxes with no symbols in the corner correspond to motorised
        components that can be controlled from the software interface.</p>
      <p>The transmitted light arm is fully controlled by the software and
        consists of a halogen <a href="#lamp">lamp</a> (<b>3</b>), shutter (<b>4</b>),
        <a href="#field"> field-stop</a> (<b>5</b>) and <a href="#condenser">condenser</a>
        (<b>6</b>). Clicking at the arrow in the lower right-hand side corner of
        the respective box opens a dialogue with settings. The <b>shutter</b> (<b>4</b>)
        is an exception as it is only toggled between two states (open/closed)
        by clicking the box. </p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="lamp" id="lamp"></a>The voltage of the <b>lamp</b>
        (<strong>3</strong>) can be set - it changes the intensity of the light
        as well as its hue (lower voltage gives "warmer" hue, with higher
        representation of the red side of the spectrum).</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="field" id="field"></a>The <b>field stop</b> (<strong>5</strong>)
        defines the illuminated area, this is used when setting <a href="#Koehler">Koehler
          illumination</a>.</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="condenser" id="condenser"></a>The <strong>condenser</strong>
        (<strong>6</strong>) settings dialogue contains selection of the <strong>mode
          of contrast</strong> (brightfield, phase contrast, DIC or darkfield);
        however, since no DIC prisms are present in the setup, DIC is not
        applicable. <strong>Phase contrast</strong> requires specialised
        objectives, check the <a href="CZ_Axio_Imager_M2.html" title="AxioImager_overview">system
          overview</a> to find which objectives support phase contrast.
        Alternatively this information can be found from objective details
        displayed at the <strong>touchscreen panel</strong>. For phase
        contrast, the objective needs to be matched with the correct phase ring
        (Ph1, Ph2 or Ph3).</p>

          alt="" title="Condeser settings"></p>
      <p> The <strong>numerical aperture</strong> of the condenser can be also
        set here. This influences the intensity of the light at sample as well
        as the contrast and resolution of the images. For <strong>brightfield</strong>
        the rule of thumb is: <em>Condenser NA = 1/2 Objective NA</em>. For <strong>phase
          contrast</strong> and <strong>darkfield</strong>, the highest
        available condenser <em>NA</em> is usually selected. Note that <strong>darkfield</strong>
        requires: <em>Condenser NA &gt; Objective NA</em>. </p>
      <p>The current condenser <strong>contrast mode/<em>NA</em></strong> is
        also displayed at the <a href="#Touchpanel">touchscreen panel</a>
        (status bar at the bottom, brightfield (BF)/<em>NA</em> = 0.9 in the
        example).</p>

      <p>The last component involved in the setting is the motorised <strong>filter
          cube turret</strong> (<b>7</b>). For transmitted light we don't need a
        filter cube, so we select the empty position.</p>
      <p>Next we'll have a look at the <strong>Camera</strong> panel. The only
        parameter here to set is the <b>exposure time</b>. For brightfiled it
        can be usually quite short (order of ms usually); for phase contrast and
        darkfield, longer exposure and/or higher <a href="#lamp">lamp voltage</a>
        are typically needed. The exposure time can be optimised automatically
        by pressing <strong>Set Exposure</strong>. See notes on <a href="#Histogram">optimising
          image intensity</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If <strong>Auto Exposure</strong> option is
        checked, the exposure time will be automatically optimised for each
        image frame captured which may result in varying exposure times within a
        series of images.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> that the camera is <strong>grey scale</strong>
        only. If you need to take transmitted light images in <strong>colour</strong>,
        you can use the following <a href="#RGBrightfield">trick</a> using
        multi-channel acquisition.</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Camera_settingTL.PNG" alt="" title="Camera_TL"><br>
      </p>
      <p>This is all for the settings. If we have loaded a sample, we can view
        it in the eyepieces or on the screen using live camera image -&nbsp; <strong>Live</strong>
        (<strong>8</strong>) or <strong>Continuous</strong> (<strong>9</strong>),
        and focus the sample by turning the <strong>focusing knob</strong>
        (located on the sides of the microscope body as well as on the side of
        the touchscreen panel). Once the sample is in focus, we can take static
        images by pressing <strong>Snap </strong>(<strong>10</strong>). See
        notes on <a href="#Histogram">adjusting the display</a> of images in
        ZEN. We can toggle the objective position between the<strong> Load
          position</strong> and the last <strong>Working position</strong>
        (position at which images were taken) by pressing the lower and upper <a

          href="#Load%20Pos">button</a> next to the focusing knob, respectively.

        imaging:</h1>
      <p><b>Locate tab</b> can be used for simple fluorescence imaging; however,

        or <a href="#mozTocId302345">multi-position</a> imaging, we need to go
        to the <strong>Acquirsition tab</strong> as we will discuss later.</p>
      <p>Let's start again with the <strong>Light Path</strong> panel. The
        fluorescence illumination arm contains mostly manually controlled
        components. The only motorised component is the <b>shutter</b> (<b>1</b>).
        The <a href="#FLfield">field stop</a> (<b style="color: #c0498f;">2</b>)
        and the <a href="#attenuator">attenuator wheel</a> (<b style="color: #c0498f;">3</b>)
        are manual. Another motorised component involved is the<b> filter cube</b>
        (<b>4</b>). This time we need to select a cube to match the fluorophore
        of interest.</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Locate_PathFL.PNG" alt="" title="Locate-Path FL"><br>
      </p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="attenuator" id="attenuator"></a>The <b>attenuator
          wheel</b> (<b style="color: #c0498f;">3</b>) reduces the excitation
        intensity reaching the sample - the higher the number set (1 - 6) the
        lower the intensity (for the actual intensities refer to the <a href="PDFs/Zeiss_WFup_intensity.pdf">table</a>).</p>

      </p>
      <p>The <strong>field stop</strong> (<b style="color: #c0498f;">2</b>)
        determines the field of view analogously to the <a href="#field">field
          stop</a> in transmitted light imaging.</p>
      <p>Next we'll need to set the camera <b>exposure time</b> in the <a href="#Camera">Camera
          panel</a>. For fluorescence it is usually on the order of 100 ms. This
        is all for the settings and we can view the live image by pressing <strong>Live</strong>
        or <strong>Continuous</strong> or take static images by pressing <strong>Snap</strong>.
        The exposure time can be optimised automatically by pressing <strong>Set
          Exposure</strong>. See notes on <a href="#Histogram">adjusting the
          display</a> of images in ZEN.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Never check <strong>Auto Exposure</strong> if
        you want to compare fluorescence intensity between images. For <strong>comparing
          intensities </strong>it is critical to<strong> acquire the images
          with identical settings</strong>, including identical exposure times.
        Auto Exposure can also result in <strong>impractically long exposure
          times</strong> when the imaged part of the sample exhibits no or
        extremely low fluorescence (e.g. when acquiring a <a href="#mozTocId302345">Tile-scan</a>
        including regions lacking fluorescent structures).</p>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>If you've set a long exposure time, it will not
        be reflected in <strong>Live</strong> mode since it's intended for
        purposes such as focusing or stage movement where a fast refresh rate of
        the live image is desirable.</p>
      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId207084" class="mozTocH1"></a>Multi-channel

      <p>For more complex imaging scenarios, we need to move to the <strong>Acquisition

        (and, of course, arbitrary combinations of those).</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> the lastly used multi-channel setting may be

        create a <strong>new setting</strong> in <a href="#mozTocId115980">Experiment

        settings for fluorescence is limited by the number of filter cubes. The
        program thus matches each fluorophore with the best match from the
        available cubes.</p>
      <p>Let us for example select a blue fluorophore such as DAPI, a red
        fluorophore such as DsRed and Brightfield. The C<strong>hannels panel</strong>
        can than look something like this: </p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="channels" id="channels"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Acquire_AddChannel2.PNG"

          alt="" title="Channels panel"></p>
      <p>By a right click on the name of the fluorophore, we can <strong>rename
          the channel</strong> (e.g. if our exact fuorophore is not in the list
        and we've selected a spectrally similar one instead). In this example
        I've renamed DAPI to BlueDye and DsRed to RedDye. You can also change
        the <strong>colour </strong>in which the images for individual channel
        will be displayed (small square to the right of the channel name).</p>
      <p>Left click on a channel selects the channel. In the example shown,
        RedDye is selected. The selected channel will be displayed in live mode
        by pressing <strong>Live</strong>. I can also set the <strong>exposure
          time</strong> for the selected channel (each channel can have
        different exposure, see notes on <a href="#Histogram">setting the
          exposure</a>) and modify the <strong>Light Path</strong>. However,
        since the only motorised component in the fluorescence light path is the
        filter cube, which is defined by the choice of the fluorophore, there's
        not really anything left to set.</p>
      <p>More settings can be adjusted for <strong>transmitted light channels</strong>.
        The only difference from setting the <strong>Light Path</strong> in <a

          href="#mozTocId883288">Locate tab</a> is the presence of check boxes
        at each component. Those indicate whether the settings for the given
        component will be a part of the channel settings. In the example shown,
        the field stop is unchecked. That means that the current opening of the
        field stop will be used for the acquisition of the channel. E.g. if I
        have two different transmitted light channels in my multi-channel
        acquisition (e.g. brightfield and darkfield) they will both have the
        same field stop opening. On the other hand, if I check the box, I can
        set a different value for each channel.</p>

      <p>You may have also noticed "Ref." in the BlueDye channel line, it stands
        for Focus Reference and is related to an option to correct for objective
        chromatic aberration (unlocked by selecting&nbsp;<img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObsZ1/SelectAll.png"

                <li>This effect can be compensated in multi-channel acquisition
                  by introducing offsets between the focus position for each

                <li>To find the offsets you need a sample with thin objects that
                  are visible in all channels of interest. Otherwise your
                  offsets may compensate for different axial distribution of

      <p>By pressing <strong>Snap</strong>, we take an image with all selected
        channels (those that are checked in the <a href="#channels">Channels
          panel</a> - checkbox is to the left of the channel name). The image
        can be displayed as an overlay of all channels (2D) or as a split view.</p>
      <p>There are two panels below the image display. Let's look at the
        left-hand side one:</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="Dimensions" id="Dimensions"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Fluor_2D_dim.png"

          alt="" title="2D-dimensions"><br>
      </p>
      <p>The control in the panel allow us to <strong>zoom in and out</strong>
        and select which channels are displayed (only the two fluorescence
        channels are displayed in the example, brightfield display is switched
        off). The <strong>Graphics</strong> tab (currently hidden) allows to
        add objects such as a <strong>scale bar</strong> to the image.</p>
      <p>The right-hand side panel shows the image histogram discussed in the
        following box:</p>
      <a class="anchor" name="Histogram" id="Histogram"></a><table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <td> Image
              histogram: </td>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Image histogram shows the distribution of pixel intensities
                  in the image. The horizontal axis shows the intensities; its
                  range corresponds to the dynamic range of the camera image.
                  The vertical axis shows the number of pixels with a given
                  intensity.</li>
                <li>The histogram is useful in optimising imaging settings, such
                  as camera exposure. Histogram reaching the highest intensity
                  values indicates that the exposure is too long or excitation
                  intensity too high. Pixels having the highest intensity value
                  are potentially <strong>saturated pixels</strong> - they
                  correspond to pixels with fluorescence intensities exceeding
                  the dynamic range. On the other, histogram crouching at the
                  low intensities end shows that the dynamic range is not
                  optimally utilised, which likely compromises the image
                  quality. A longer exposure would likely help.</li>
                <li>For a multi-channel image, histograms for all channels are
                  shown together with lines indicating the <strong>scaling of
                    the image</strong> display for each channel (below what
                  intensity value pixels are displayed in black and above what
                  intensity value the pixels are displayed in maximum
                  brightness). Adjusting the display scaling helps to visualise
                  channels with different intensities.</li>
                <li><strong>Best Fit</strong> is meant to optimise the image
                  scaling for the best possible display. The result is not
                  necessarily always the best possible. <strong>Min/Max</strong>&nbsp;
                  stretches the scaling between the lowest and the highest pixel
                  intensity for a given channel.<br>

                <li>Note that the changes in the <strong>scaling do not modify
                    the image itself</strong>, only the way it is currently
                  displayed. It will therefore not alter the way the image is

        acquisition:</h1>
      <p>To acquire a stack of images at different Z-planes check Z-stack
        option:</p>
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Z-stack.PNG" alt="" title="Z-stack"></p>
      <p>Z-stack panel will be added to the settings panels in the left-hand
        side container. To define a stack, focus to the lowest plane you want to
        acquire and press:<strong> Set First</strong>. Then focus to the
        uppermost plane and press <strong>Set Last</strong>. The number of
        slices in the stack is determined by the range and the interval between
        slices. Interval that satisfies Nyquist sampling for the axial
        resolution of the selected objective is suggested as <strong>Optimal </strong>(1.45
        μm in the example shown). </p>
      <p>Once the stack is set, start the acquisition by pressing <strong>Start
          Experiment</strong>. The stack will be recorded for all channels
        checked in the <a href="#channels">Channels panel</a>.</p>
      <p>Z-stack can be then viewed by individual planes, as orthogonal sections
        or as 3D rendering (see the tabs to the left of the displayed image).</p>
      <p> <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Z-stack2.PNG" alt="" title="Z-stack view">
      </p>
      <p>Alternatively, Z-stack can be set up by selecting the <strong>central
          plane</strong> and the range (centre +/- half of the range). This
        option is unlocked by selecting&nbsp;<img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObsZ1/SelectAll.png"

          alt="" title="Show All"> for <strong>Z-stack panel</strong>. Focus to

        imaging:</h1>
      <p>The motorised stage can be used to set a few types of multi-position
        imaging experiments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tiles</strong> scan - acquire an image larger than the field
          of view of the camera by stitching together multiple images acquired
          at neighbouring positions.</li>
        <li><strong>Positions</strong> - remembers a list of selected stage
          positions, which can be then imaged repeatedly. This makes sense
          mainly in combination with time-lapse imaging, when it allows to
          monitor in time multiple locations within the sample.</li>
        <li><strong>Sample-carrier</strong>-specific position grids - for
          standard sample carriers such as a 96-well plates allows setting up
          easily acquisition at a regular positions grid (e.g. each well of the
          plate).</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Check the <strong>Tiles</strong> option and a Tiles panel will be
        added:</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Tiles_1.PNG" alt="" title="Multi-positions">
      <p> The upper part of the panel allows defining the <strong>Tile scan</strong>
        - in the example shown the scan will cover a field of 2x2 fields of
        view, by pressing the&nbsp;<img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/TilesArrow_1.png"

          alt="" title="tiles-arrow2"> button it is added to the list of Tile
        scan regions (multiple regions can be defined and then all of them
        imaged).</p>
      <p>If you are imaging a single large object (e.g. a tissue section) and
        want to make sure that you capture the whole object, select <strong>Stake</strong>
        option. You will then move the stage to several positions at the
        boundaries of the object and store those positions (called <strong>Markers</strong>
        in this context). The program will then set the tiles regions in such a
        way that it contains all the stored positions.</p>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Because of the orientation at which the
        camera is mounted, you will need to rotate the camera image by <strong>180
          deg</strong>. This can be set in the <strong>Acquisition Mode</strong>
        panel:</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Tiles_Acq_setting.PNG" alt="" title="Acq. Setting_Tiles">
      <p>Acquisition at a set of discreet positions can be set in the lower part
        of the Tiles panel. Move the stage to the desired position and press <img

          src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/TilesArrow_2.png" alt="" title="tiles-arow2">.
        The position will be stored in the list of positions. Repeat this step
        for all other positions to populate a list of arbitrary positions.
        Another option is to select a <strong>Sample carrier</strong> from the
        list (e.g. 96-well plate). Then press <strong>Calibrate...</strong> and
        you will be prompted to move the stage to selected reference wells.
        Based on those reference positions, the program will calculate the grid
        of positions of all wells in the plate allowing setting up an automated
        acquisition in all (or selected) wells of the plate.</p>

        imaging:</h1>
      <p>Setting up a time-lapse acquisition is very straightforward. Check the
        <strong>Time series</strong> option and a Time Series panel will be
        added. You can set the number of time points to be acquired (100 in the
        example) and the interval between them (5 min. in the example). If you
        want to acquire images with the maximum temporal resolution possible,
        set the interval to zero and check the option "Use Camera Streaming if
        Possible". Start acquisition for all selected channels by pressing Start
        Experiment.</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId528749" class="mozTocH1"></a>Saving images:</h1>
      <p>Acquired images are listed in the image explorer panel at the
        right-hand side of ZEN window. For each image the name, size, thumbnail
        and icons indicating image type are shown. In this example we see a
        multi-channel image (C), a multi-channel Z-stack and a multi-channel
        Tile-scan. Image (selected by double-clicking on it) can be saved by
        clicking the <strong>floppy-disk button</strong> (highlighted for the
        benefit of younger users not familiar with the early history of data
        storage). </p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Save.PNG" alt="" title="saving">
      <p>This is not very convenient for saving large numbers of images. If you
        want to acquire many images, it is useful to set up <strong>Autosave</strong>
        option in a dedicated panel in the settings area on the left-hand side.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Autosave.PNG" alt="" title="autosave">
      <p>Select a folder for your images at one of the data drives (D: to G:).
        ZEN will automatically create a subfolder there named according to the
        current date. Set a base name for your images - all images will then
        have the name with a number differentiating individual images.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The images you see open in ZEN (in the image
        explorer panel) are not the ones that is saved to disk by autosave. Any
        changes to the images after acquisition (e.g. adding scale bars) do not
        modify the autosaved images and the modified images need to be saved
        separately.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Autosave</strong> applies only to
        images acquired under the <strong>Acquisition tab</strong>. Images
        Acquired in the Locate tab by pressing Snap, are not saved
        automatically.</p>
      <p>When <strong>closing ZEN</strong>, a window will appear with the list
        of modified files asking whether they should be saved. Do not be
        disturbed if all images appear there as unsaved when you are using
        autosave - that does not mean that the autosave is not working (see the
        note above). Besides images, the list also contains all <a href="#mozTocId115980">Experiment
          Manager</a> files that have been opened during the session. You can
        uncheck all and not save any changes if you have saved all your images
        (e.g. by Autosave). Note that saving any images in this way saves them
        to a default image location rather than letting you choose the
        destination.</p>
      <h1 class="h1"><a id="mozTocId115980" class="mozTocH1"></a>Saving imaging
