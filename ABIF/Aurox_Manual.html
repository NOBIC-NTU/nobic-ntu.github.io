      <h2 class="h2"><a id="TL" class="mozTocH1"></a>Transmitted light imaging:</h2>
      <p>A simple transmitted light imaging experiment can be set up in the <b>
          Locate tab</b>. In general, the Locate tab allows you to set any
        simple imaging experiment; however, for more complex automated
        acquisition modes such as <a href="#MC">multi-channel</a> or <a href="#MP">multi-position</a>
        imaging, we need to go to the <strong>Acquisition tab</strong> as we
        will discuss later.</p>
      <p>There are two panels in the Locate tab: <strong>Light Path</strong>
        and <a href="#Camera">Camera</a>. Let us look at the <strong>Light
          Path</strong> first. The panel displays a diagram of microscope parts
        in a topology corresponding to their physical locations (what is on top
        in the diagram is on top in reality).</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/Locate-Trans.JPG" alt="" title="Locate-TL">
      <p>The transmitted light arm is almost fully controlled by the software
        and consists of a <a href="#lamp">lamp</a> (<b>1</b>), shutter (<strong>2</strong>),
        <a href="#field"> field-stop</a> (<b style="color: #c0498f;">3</b>, not

        path, see the <a href="#condenser_im">image</a> below) and <a href="#condenser">condenser</a>
        (<b>4</b>). Clicking at the arrow in the lower right-hand side corner of
        the respective box opens a dialogue with settings. The <b>shutter</b> (<b>2</b>)
        is an exception as it is only toggled between two states (open/closed)
        by clicking the box. </p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="lamp" id="lamp"></a>The voltage of the <b>lamp</b>

          title="AxioObserver7_overview">system overview</a> to find which
        objectives support phase contrast. Alternatively this information can be
        found from objective details displayed at the <strong>touchscreen panel</strong>.
        For phase contrast, the objective needs to be matched with the correct
        phase ring (Ph1, Ph2 or Ph3). </p>

      <p>For <strong>DIC</strong>, the objective has to be matched with the
        correct prism in the condenser (see the details at the <strong>touchscreen

      <p> The <strong>numerical aperture</strong> of the condenser can be also
        set here. This influences the intensity of the light at sample as well
        as the contrast and resolution of the images. For <strong>brightfield</strong>
        the rule of thumb is: <em>Condenser NA = </em><em><em>(0.6 to 0.8)</em>
          Objective NA</em>. For <strong>phase contrast</strong><strong></strong>,
        the highest available condenser <em>NA</em> is usually selected.</p>
      <p>The current condenser <strong>contrast mode/<em>NA</em></strong> is
        also displayed at the <a href="#Touchpanel">touchscreen panel</a>
        (status bar at the bottom, brightfield (BF)/<em>NA</em> = 0.9 in the
        example).</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="downstream" id="downstream"></a>Other
        components are common for the transmitted light and fluorescence paths;
        they are the <strong>objective revolver</strong> (<strong>5</strong>),
        the<strong> beamsplitter</strong> (<strong>6</strong>), the <strong>emission
          filter</strong> (<strong>7</strong>), the <a href="#tubelens">tube
          lens</a> (<strong>8</strong>) and the <a href="#phototube">intermediate
          phototube</a><strong> </strong>(<strong>9</strong>).</p>
      <p>For transmitted light we need neither a filter nor beamsplitter, so we
        select empty positions for both.</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="tubelens" id="tubelens"></a>The <strong>tube
          lens</strong> turret (<strong>8</strong>) has three positions: 1x
        magnification, 1.6x magnification and 2.5x magnification; the overall
        image magnification is <em>Tube-lens magnification x Objective
          magnification</em>).</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="phototube" id="phototube"></a>The <strong>intermediate
          phototube </strong>(<strong>9</strong>) selects whether the light
        will go to the eyepiece or to the camera. The right-hand camera port is
        used for widefield imaging (Axio Observer 7). You can also control this
        from the touchscreen panel:</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/Touchpanel_tube.jpg" alt="" title="touchpanel_phototube">
      <p><a class="anchor" name="Camera" id="Camera"></a>Next we'll have a look
        at the <strong>Camera</strong> panel. The only parameter here to set is
        the <b>exposure time</b>. For brightfield it can be usually quite short
        (order of ms usually); for phase contrast and darkfield, longer exposure
        and/or higher <a href="#lamp">lamp voltage</a> are typically needed.
        The exposure time can be optimised automatically by pressing <strong>Set
          Exposure</strong>. See notes on <a href="#Histogram">optimising image
          intensity</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> If <strong>Auto Exposure</strong> option is
        checked, the exposure time will be automatically optimised for each
        image frame captured which may result in varying exposure times within a
        series of images.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/Camera.JPG" alt="" title="Camera">
      <p>This is all for the settings. If we have loaded a sample, we can view
        it in the eyepieces or on the screen using live camera image -&nbsp; <strong>Live</strong>
        (<strong>11</strong>) or <strong>Continuous</strong> (<strong>12</strong>),
        and focus the sample by turning the <strong>focusing knob</strong>
        (located on the sides of the microscope body as well as on the side of
        the touchscreen panel). Once the sample is in focus, we can take static
        images by pressing <strong>Snap </strong>(<strong>13</strong>). See
        notes on <a href="#Histogram">adjusting the display</a> of images in
        ZEN.</p>
      <p>We can toggle the objective position between the<strong> Load position</strong>
        and the last <strong>Working position</strong> (position at which
        images were taken) by pressing the buttons next to the focusing knob or
        on the touchscreen panel.</p>

          intensity</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Never check <strong>Auto Exposure</strong> if
        you want to compare fluorescence intensity between images. For <strong>comparing
          intensities </strong>it is critical to<strong> acquire the images
          with identical settings</strong>, including identical exposure times.
        Auto Exposure can also result in <strong>impractically long exposure
          times</strong> when the imaged part of the sample exhibits no or
        extremely low fluorescence (e.g. when acquiring a <a href="#MP">Tile-scan</a>
        including regions lacking fluorescent structures).</p>
      <p><strong>Note: </strong>If you've set a long exposure time, it will not
        be reflected in <strong>Live</strong> mode since it's intended for
        purposes such as focusing or stage movement where a fast refresh rate of
        the live image is desirable.</p>
      <h2 class="h2"><a id="MC" class="mozTocH1"></a>Multi-channel imaging:</h2>
      <p>For more complex imaging scenarios, we need to move to the <strong>Acquisition
          tab</strong>, where we can set up acquisition of <a href="#MC">multi-channel
          images</a>, <a href="#Z">Z-stacks</a>, <a href="#MP">multi-position
          images</a>, or <a href="#T">time-lapse acquisition</a> (and, of
        course, arbitrary combinations of those).</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> the lastly used multi-channel setting may be
        loaded automatically. To setup your own setting from the beginning,
        create a <strong>new setting</strong> in <a href="#Sett">Experiment
          Manager</a>.</p>
      <p>To set up a multi-channel acquisition, add channels by pressing the
        dedicated button in <strong>Channels panel</strong>. A window with a
        selection of fluorescent dyes will pop up, where you can select and add
        dyes identical or close to those in your sample. Different transmitted
        light contrast modes can be added as well.</p>
      <a class="anchor" name="Addchannnel" id="Addchannel"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/AddChan.JPG"

        alt="" title="Add channel">
      <p><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Acquire_AddChannel1b.png" alt="" title="Add Channel-pop up"></p>
      <p>Note that the selection is vastly redundant, since the number of actual
        settings for fluorescence is limited by the number of excitation
        filters. The program thus matches each fluorophore with the best match
        from the available excitation filters.</p>
      <p>Let us for example select a green fluorophore such as EGFP and
        Brightfield. The <strong>Channels panel</strong> can than look
        something like this:</p>
      <a class="anchor" name="channels" id="channels"> </a><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/Channel_acq2.JPG"

        alt="" title="Acquire-Channels">
      <p>Left click on a channel selects the channel. In the example shown, EGFP
        is selected. The selected channel will be displayed in live mode by
        pressing <strong>Live</strong>. You can set the <strong>exposure time</strong>
        for the selected channel (each channel can have different exposure, see
        here for notes on <a href="#Histogram">setting the exposure</a>) as
        well as the intensity of the <strong>Lightsource</strong>. The <strong>Lightsource</strong>
        dropdown menu contains 3 options: Transmitted light LED, Epifluorescence
        lamp (XCite) and Use Settings; the last option automatically selects the
        lightsource according to the imaging modality (fluorescence or
        transmitted light) but doesn't allow setting the intensity.</p>
      <p>You can also modify the <strong>Light Path</strong> for each channel.
        Most settings are determined by the selections of the imaging modality
        (transmitted light or fluorescence) and for fluorescence channels by the
        selection of the fluorophore and should be loaded according to the
        modality and fluorophore selected.</p>
      <p>A component which it potentially makes sense to set here is the <a href="#condenser">condenser</a>
        for transmitted light channels. The difference from lightpath setting in
        <a href="#TL">Locate tab</a> is the presence of check boxes for each
        setting which allow you to select whether the settings will be a part of
        the channel settings. In the example shown, both NA and Contrast mode
        are checked. That means for example that the current NA (0.3) will be a
        part of the channel settings. If I want to acquire two different
        transmitted light channels, I can set different condenser NA for each
        channel (e.g. for phase contrast I would use the maximum NA of the
        condenser). If this box is unchecked for all channels, they will be
        imaged with the same condenser NA whatever its value is at the start of
        the image acquisition.</p>
      <p>Components the settings of which are a <strong>part of the channel
          settings are displayed in blue</strong>, components which are not a
        part of the channel settings are diplayed in gray. <strong></strong>When
        you add channels using <a href="#Addchannnel">Add-channel dialogue</a>,
        the software should take care that all relevant components settings
        change correctly when switching between channels (such as transmitted
        light vs. epifluorescence lamp shutters and optical filters). In case
        you observe issues (e.g. transmitted ligt contributing to the
        fluorescence channels or all fluorescence channels excited by the same
        wavelength), which may happen under some circumstances, revisited the
        channels' settings to make sure all relevant components (shutters,
        filter wheels) <strong>are blue</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Important: </strong>To achieve the <strong>highest possible
          imaging speed</strong>, you may, on the other hand, want to make sure
        all <strong>components that don't need to change</strong> between
        channels <strong>are gray</strong> (e.g. for multiple fluorescence
        channels only the excitation filter wheel needs to switch, the
        multi-band dichroic and emission filter are the same for all).<strong><br>

      <p>You may have also noticed "Ref." in the EGFP channel line, it stands
        for Focus Reference and is related to an option to correct for objective
        chromatic aberration as explained in the following box:</p>

                <li>Chromatic aberration causes the focal planes for different

                <li>This effect can be compensated in multi-channel acquisition
                  by introducing offsets between the focus position for each
                  channel.</li>
                <li>To find the offsets you need a sample with thin objects that
                  are visible in all channels of interest. Otherwise your
                  offsets may compensate for different axial distribution of
                  different fluorophores rather than for the chromatic
                  aberration.</li>
                <li>One channel is selected as reference (EGFP channel in this

      <p>By pressing <strong>Snap</strong>, we take an image with all selected
        channels (those that are checked in the <a href="#channels">Channels
          panel</a> - checkbox is to the left of the channel name). The image
        can be displayed as an overlay of all channels (2D) or as a split view.</p>
      <p>There are two panels below the image display. Let's look at the
        left-hand side one:</p>
      <p><a class="anchor" name="Dimensions" id="Dimensions"></a><img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/Dimensions.JPG"

          alt="" title="Image-dimensions"><br>
      </p>
      <p>The control in the panel allow us to <strong>zoom in and out</strong>
        and select which channels are displayed (only the two fluorescence
        channels are displayed in the example, brightfield display is switched
        off). The <strong>Graphics</strong> tab (currently hidden) allows to
        add objects such as a <strong>scale bar</strong> to the image.</p>
      <p>The right-hand side panel shows the image histogram discussed in the
        following box:</p>
      <a class="anchor" name="Histogram" id="Histogram"></a>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>

          <tr>
            <td>
              <ul>
                <li>Image histogram shows the distribution of pixel intensities
                  in the image. The horizontal axis shows the intensities; its
                  range corresponds to the dynamic range of the camera image.
                  The vertical axis shows the number of pixels with a given
                  intensity.</li>
                <li>The histogram is useful in optimising imaging settings, such
                  as camera exposure. Histogram reaching the highest intensity
                  values indicates that the exposure is too long or excitation
                  intensity too high. Pixels having the highest intensity value
                  are potentially <strong>saturated pixels</strong> - they
                  correspond to pixels with fluorescence intensities exceeding
                  the dynamic range. On the other, histogram crouching at the
                  low intensities end shows that the dynamic range is not
                  optimally utilised, which likely compromises the image
                  quality. A longer exposure would likely help.</li>
                <li>For a multi-channel image, histograms for all channels are
                  shown together with lines indicating the <strong>scaling of
                    the image</strong> display for each channel (below what
                  intensity value pixels are displayed in black and above what
                  intensity value the pixels are displayed in maximum
                  brightness). Adjusting the display scaling helps to visualise
                  channels with different intensities.</li>
                <li><strong>Best Fit</strong> is meant to optimise the image
                  scaling for the best possible display. The result is not
                  necessarily always the best possible. <strong>Min/Max</strong>
                  stretches the scaling between the lowest and the highest pixel
                  intensity for a given channel.<br>

                <li>Note that the changes in the <strong>scaling do not modify
                    the image itself</strong>, only the way it is currently
                  displayed. It will therefore not alter the way the image is

      <p>Z-stack panel will be added to the settings panels in the left-hand
        side container. To define a stack, focus to the lowest plane you want to
        acquire and press:<strong> Set First</strong>. Then focus to the
        uppermost plane and press <strong>Set Last</strong>. The number of
        slices in the stack is determined by the range and the interval between
        slices. Interval that satisfies Nyquist sampling for the axial
        resolution of the selected objective is suggested as <strong>Optimal </strong>(4.08
        μm in the example shown).</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/Z-stack.JPG" alt="" title="Z-stack">
      <p>Alternatively, Z-stack can be set up by selecting the <strong>central

        <strong>Center tab</strong> instead of the First/Last tab in the <strong>Z-stack
          panel</strong>. Focus to the central plane, confirm it as the centre
        of the stack by pressing <strong>Center</strong> and define the range
        and interval between slices. Use this option when working with
        autofocus; the autofocus will maintain the selected focal plane as the

      <p>If you are imaging a single large object (e.g. a tissue section) and
        want to make sure that you capture the whole object, select <strong>Stake</strong>
        option. You will then move the stage to several positions at the
        boundaries of the object and store those positions (called <strong>Markers</strong>
        in this context). The program will then set the tiles regions in such a
        way that it contains all the stored positions. <strong>Important:</strong>
        Because of the orientation at which the camera is mounted, the images
        need to be rotated by <strong>90 deg counter-clockwise</strong> for the
        tiles to connect correctly. This can be set in the <strong>Acquisition

        The position will be stored in the list of positions. Repeat this step

        Another option is to select a <strong>Sample carrier</strong> from the

      <p>The microscope is equipped with Definite Focus.2 hardware autofocus
        based on reflection of infrared light from an optical interface
        (typically the interface between the cover glass and the sample). It
        helps to compensate for temporal drift of focus during time-lapse
        imaging. Its current status is shown in the right-hand side container of
        ZEN window.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/DefiniteFocus.jpg" alt="" title="Definite Focus">
      <p>The microscope can automatically search for the interface (<strong>Find
          Surface</strong>) by which it helps you to focus your sample. After
        focusing on the interface you can adjust the focus (by the focusing
        knob) to bring the structures of interest (typically located some small
        distance above the interface) to focus. You can then store the focus
        position (<strong>Store Focus</strong>) or lock it (<strong>Lock focus</strong>),
        in which case the microscope will maintain the currently focused plane
        in focus.</p>
      <p>When doing a (multi-position) time-lapse, you can set up autofocus to

        right-hand side of ZEN window. For each image the name, size, thumbnail
        and icons indicating image type are shown. In this example we see a
        multi-channel image (C), a multi-channel Z-stack and a multi-channel
        Tile-scan. Image (selected by double-clicking on it) can be saved by
        clicking the <strong>floppy-disk button</strong> (highlighted for the
        benefit of younger users not familiar with the early history of data
        storage). </p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioImager/Save.PNG" alt="" title="saving">
      <p>This is not very convenient for saving large numbers of images. If you
        want to acquire many images, it is useful to set up <strong>Auto save</strong>
        option in a dedicated panel in the settings area on the left-hand side.
        Check the Auto Save option in the <a href="#Experiment">experiment
          settings</a> area of the left-hand side container and go to the <strong>Auto
          Save pane</strong>l to set the path for saving images.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/Autosave.JPG" title="Autosave"><br>
      <p>Select a folder for your images at the data drive (D:). ZEN will
        automatically create a sub-folder there named according to the current
        date. Set a base name for your images - all images will then have the
        name with a number differentiating individual images.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> The images you see open in ZEN (in the image
        explorer panel) are not the ones that are saved to disk by auto save.
        Any changes to the images after acquisition (e.g. adding scale bars) do
        not modify the auto saved images and the modified images need to be
        re-saved.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Auto Save</strong> applies only to
        images acquired under the <strong>Acquisition tab</strong>. Images
        Acquired in the Locate tab by pressing Snap, are not saved
        automatically. </p>
      <p>When <strong>closing ZEN</strong>, a window will appear with the list
        of modified files asking whether they should be saved. Do not be
        disturbed if all images appear there as unsaved when you are using auto
        save - that does not mean that the auto save is not working (see the
        note above). Besides images, the list also contains all <a href="#Sett">Experiment
          Manager</a> files that have been opened during the session. You can
        uncheck all and not save any changes if you have saved all your images
        (e.g. by Auto Save). Note that saving any images in this way saves them
        to a default image location rather than letting you choose the
        destination.</p>
      <h2 class="h2"><a id="Sett" class="mozTocH1"></a>Saving imaging settings:</h2>
      <p>Acquisition settings can be saved for future use in <strong>Experiment
          Manager</strong> (open a drop-down menu by pressing&nbsp;<img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/Experiment_button.jpg"

          alt="" title="experiment manager settings"> and select Save As and
        give the settings a name by which you can later recognise the file;
        ideally include your name to make it clear whose settings those are). In
        the example settings file called Experiment7 is open; other settings
        files can be chosen from a drop-down list.</p>
      <img src="Media/Manuals/AxioObs7/Experiment_reuse.JPG" alt="" title="Experiment Manager"><br>
      <p>The settings are also stored in the image <strong>metadata</strong>
        and settings used to acquire an image can be recalled by the <strong>Reuse
          button</strong> when the image is open.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> neither experiment manager nor the image
        metadata collect information about <strong>manually controlled
          components</strong>. Make sure you note those down to be able to
        reproduce your experiments.</p>
